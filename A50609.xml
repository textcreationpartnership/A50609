            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Could not (dearly beloved) but judge it my Duty, to Dedicate theſe Sermons unto you: part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe you are my peculiar Care and Charge in the Lord, unto whom I do ow my Labour and Pains; and alſo by reaſon of that joint Requeſt you were pleaſed to Attack me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, <hi>viz.</hi> that they might be made Publick; giving me good aſſurance that they might be of great uſe for the good of Chriſtians in this place. I have here (though it be againſt my own inclination) anſwered your deſire; Let this undertaking be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with your ſerious and ſolemn Prayer, that your hopes of good may be accompliſhed. What I have wrote in my Epiſtle to the Readers, many
<pb facs="tcp:44339:3"/>of you can teſtifie, you well know what a long time of Silence I have had; how deſirous I was to live in peace; that alwaies being eſteemed a Jewel of great price with me, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the duſt that hath been raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the darkening of the Air a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, might have fallen without any attempt of mine to ſuppreſs it; but the violent effort of the Pulpit, and the furious Reports of the Preſs, have ſomething awakened me from that eaſe and quiet, I ſhould have been glad longer to have ſolaced my ſelf withall: But alas it was time to be ſomething alarmed, when the flames were inkindled about us, and our little Field in danger of being conſumed, here is one that hath put this place even into a Conflagration. I ſhall (I doubt not) fall under the laſh of many cenſuring Tongues, for this ſmall endeavour, to vindicate this one exploded (though precious) Truth of Chriſt. You have had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of my ſpirit and deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and cannot from the ſtricteſt
<pb facs="tcp:44339:3"/>obſervations you have made of me, but ſay, that ſo far as may be, I have been willing to live in peace with all men, and what care I have taken to preſerve peace in the midſt of and round about you. It would be matter of much comfort to me, may this little Eſſay be inſtrumental to reduce this place into ſomewhat a more ſedate and calm temper: My Practice (ever ſince the Lord was plaſed to call me amongſt you) hath been to give perpetual demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that I live, and can walk with all that are ſound in the Faith, and of an unblameable Converſation. I found you fixed upon that Noble, Evangelical Foundation, which I have endeavoured to build upon. Your laudable Principle is, that U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt, is the great ground of our Communion one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; let us magnifie God, for what we have found of his Gracious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Bleſſing, ſince we came together, and ſtand in that relation as we do one to the other. I do with
<pb facs="tcp:44339:4"/>much importunity requeſt your Prayers, that I may daily have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance from you at the Throne of rich Grace: Watch againſt all deſigns of men that lye in wait to deceive, and to diſturb our peace: Study much the Covenant of Grace, bleſſed be the Lord that he hath not only ingrafted you, but alſo your Seed into it. You that have Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, plead the Promiſes of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God for them: Take heed of ſuch Principles, that do ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably exclude your dear Babes out of the Kingdom of God, and render their Salvation (provided they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in their infancy) not only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, but in any ordinary way impoſſible. Beg the Lord to put a ſtop, and to give a Check to that lying malicious ſpirit, that like a ſpiteful Ghoſt walks in this poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed ſpot. I doubt not, but what I have here tranſmitted from the Preſs, will be attended with the ſame opprobrious Cenſure it met withal from the Pulpit; many ignorant and
<pb facs="tcp:44339:4"/>raſh hot-headed Profeſſors did ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely judge me, and my Sermons, that never heard them; and ſo I do expect many will that ſhall never read them, pour out their profound invectives againſt them. I muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no better quarter, than honeſt Mr. <hi>Giles Shute,</hi> who by many was caſt and condemned, that never read his Books, neither were able to paſs a right Judgment upon them. I do heartily wiſh, that a greater number of my <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> Neighbours, would labour more after the life and power of Religion; and Study to know their own hearts better: then I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe my ſelf they would not be ſo prompt, and ready to undervalue and condemn others, as they be. I cannot but admire to ſee what a change is upon their ſpirits, words, and actions: in our late times of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint they could be glad (many of them) to partake of my poor pains, and ſometime ſince; but I do not ſo much wonder at them, as at their Teacher, who ever ſince the laſt
<pb facs="tcp:44339:5"/>breaking forth of our Liberty, hath ſo much inveighed againſt all that are not of his opinion, and hath laid ſo much ſtreſs and weight upon his Notion, about Baptiſm, that hath diſtilled ſuch bitterneſs into the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of many, that they be turned very ſowre and moroſe, to thoſe that cannot imbibe their Sentiments. I bleſs the Lord, that I can ſay, I have not been the Incendiary among us; I lay ſtill Six or Seven years till all was (from Pulpit and Preſs by Mr. <hi>Collins</hi>) put into Flames about us: It is next to a wonder to me that any ſhould be ſo impudent, as to accuſe me to be the Author of all the trouble that doth annoy us, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding my long ſilence, and that little oppoſition that yet I have made againſt a turbulent ſpirit: that he might diſcover the uttermoſt of his bitterneſs, I muſt have him ſeveral times, to pronounce in his Pulpit before all his Congregation, an open Challenge againſt me. I do expect that ſo ſoon as theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
<pb facs="tcp:44339:5"/>ſhall have an acceſs to his hands, that we ſhall hear ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his tumultuous ſpirit: I have made a few remarks (as you may ſee) upon his bold and undigeſted Doctrine, raſhly and ignorantly thruſt forth into the World; giving you but a few Gleanings, to that Harveſt, I may (if occaſion be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered) preſent you withall. I make no queſtion, but my challenger will quickly fill our Ears with his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, be it ſo, the Lord (I hope) will enable us to make our reply: I deſire that he would remember, the nature of his Challenge, that it was a ſingle Duel, without propounding any Seconds, that he hath engaged me in. Stand faſt in the Lord (my dearly beloved) as ye have received the Lord Jeſus, ſo walk ye in him, as ye have received how ye ought to walk, ſo walk at all times, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound yet more and more; while ſome, and that not a few, are cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up an Opinion not neceſſary to Salvation; let your Zeal run out
<pb facs="tcp:44339:6"/>after thoſe Truths of the Goſpel in the believing, and practiſing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, you may obtain Salvation, and greatly rejoyce in the day of our Lord Jeſus. Love one another; pity and pray one for the other; live in peace and love; and the God of Love and Peace ſhall dwell with you. Finally, my Brethren, be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might; I commend you to God, and the Word of his Grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them that are ſanctified; that he in order thereunto, would be pleaſed to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil all the good pleaſure of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs within you, and the work of Faith with power, is the hearty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of him, that is</p>

            <head>The EPISTLE To the Candid and Impartial READERS, Eſpecially thoſe unto whom the following Sermons were Preached.</head>
            <p>WE live in a day, and Age of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in which the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, produceth many ſtrange things; behold here is preſented unto your eyes, the ſubſtance of two poor Sermons with conſiderable enlargement, that are expos'd (through great importunity) to the open light in the World. I have been very averſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the grieved and groaning Preſs, that is overcharg'd by ſuch Writings, which were only fit (after they have been utter'd in the Pulpit) to be adjudg'd to the perpetual Grave of Oblivion; ſuch I readily confeſs are theſe Sermons, and deſerve no better Cenſure: It is a Prodigy to my ſelf, that I ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd upon, to ſuffer theſe Papers to appear with an open face, and to be expos'd to the view of many. I ſenſibly, and feelingly find cauſe every day, more and more, to bewail, and to bluſh at my own ignorance and incapacity, for the work of the Miniſtry, though I have
<pb facs="tcp:44339:7"/>not been vacant of many Solicitations, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd with the Tears of ſerious Chriſtians, that I would admit ſome of my Labours to be Printed: But at the ſame time a cold damp hath ſeiz'd my Spirits, from a deep convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my inſufficiency for ſuch an undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; judging it to be my Duty, to be like the Deaf Adder, not to hearken to ſuch Charms, but to be inexorable: You may then demand, how comes it to paſs, that theſe two Sermons have obtain'd more than all the reſt ever could?</p>
            <p>I have not only conſider'd the Importunity of dear friends, (I did formerly withſtand) which of it ſelf could never have prevail'd; but am fallen under a Conviction, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential Call of my Lord and Maſter doth oblige me, by reaſon of the great diſhonour, that is brought to his moſt ſacred and pure Name, from various infamous Doctrines, that have been divulged amongſt us; and that with ſuch heat and fervor, that we are upon this little ſpot in an Inflammation, yea near unto a Conflagration; inſomuch that out of conſciouſneſs of Duty, and the importunity of thoſe whoſe hearts do bleed within them, I could forbear no longer, but went unto the Sanctuary, to fill my ſhallow Bucket, with ſome of the cooling and quenching waters, that iſſue from under the Threſhold thereof. Oh! that there might be a bleſſing attending this my
<pb facs="tcp:44339:7"/>Eſſay; we are ſo ſet on fire round about us, (by a man of a vehement Spirit) that ſeems to threaten all about him, oppoſite to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, quickly to be conſum'd and reduc'd to aſhes; God be pleas'd, graciouſly to allay his heat, and quench his falſe fiery Zeal.</p>
            <p>It is well known, that for ſix or ſeven years, I have born with his unparallell'd Confidence, in his frequent inveighing againſt Infants-Baptiſm, with many inſufferable reflections upon us that are in judgment and practice different from him. He hath, (beſides his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Excurſions) an anniverſary day, <hi>(ex propoſito)</hi> to batter us with his Rams to the ground. A long time we have made no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance againſt him, (as many of you that attend upon my Miniſtry well know) but have patiently receiv'd the furious fire of his Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides: Good Chriſtians have repair'd unto me, begging me to lift up the Standard of Gods Word againſt him; but my reply to them was, Wiſdom ſhould reſt in the Boſom of ſome, and that I knew not how ſhort-liv'd (conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the various Threatnings of a Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, for a multitude of crying Sins that abound among us; particularly the animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and diſſentions of the Profeſſors of the Goſpel) our preſent enjoyments might be; adding, that I judg'd the Will of my Lord was, that I ſhould improve that little Talent he hath pleas'd to intruſt me withal, (to the
<pb facs="tcp:44339:8"/>utmoſt of my power) in preaching upon the weighty and moſt neceſſary Truths of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, whereby (through Grace) I might ſave my ſelf, and thoſe that hear me, <hi>1 Tim. 4.16.</hi> Some of his followers waxed bold, looking upon what he delivered, to proceed out of the mouth of an infallible Oracle, crying out of me, why doth he not anſwer Mr. <hi>C.</hi> and preach up his ſprinkling of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; if he had any thing to ſay, he would not be ſilent. Yea, ſome have been ſo impudent, as to ſay, that what he doth, as to the baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Infants, is againſt the light of his own Conſcience: To ſuch bold Accuſers and Boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, I ſhall only return in the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 14.4. Who art thou that judgeſt another mans ſervant? to his own Maſter he ſtandeth or falleth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is common amongſt us, for thoſe that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not the right hand from the left in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great point of the things of God, to judge and condemn the moſt judicious and pious, that are not of their Meaſures about Baptiſm; let but a man renounce his Baby ſprinkling (as they ſcornfully call it) and paſs under the Water, he is an excellent Chriſtian. If ſome of their Preachers be never ſo raw, crude <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd illiterate, and can lay about them with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Confidence, though mingled with a great quantity of Nonſenſe, yet they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd by them being for dipping, without which
<pb facs="tcp:44339:8"/>what is all the Learning, Experience, Piety, Pains, and ſincere endeavours of faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in ſerving ſouls? It may grieve any one that hath a ſerious conſideration of the worth of Souls, and the weightineſs of the work of the Miniſtry upon his Heart, to hear, how all that thoſe deliver, that decry the Baptizing of Infants, is magnified, as flowing from the Spirit of the Lord, though much that is vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is but the apparent <hi>(proles)</hi> or off-ſpring of Pride, Ignorance and Confidence. Oh! let not my ſoul enter into their Secrets: who is ſufficient for theſe things? I wiſh that there be not only contempt heaped upon the Word of the Lord and his Miniſtry, but alſo blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my upon the Spirit: Let men take heed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too bold in fathering their paſſionate Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and Invectives againſt their Betters, upon the Holy Ghoſt; Oh! that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for theſe things!</p>
            <p>To compleat all, the high place in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation is not ſufficient to diſcharge the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the ſtomach againſt us, but the Preſs muſt alſo groan to bring forth, that there may nothing appear but dung and filth upon our faces, and all the beauty of Religion, and Evangelical Order of the Goſpel we walk in, may be totally defac'd. From the Preſs hath been ſent into the midſt of us, two Pamphlets, like unto <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Foxes that were join'd in
<pb facs="tcp:44339:9"/>the Tail with fire-brands betwixt them to burn down all our Field; as if nothing leſs than the total deſtruction of our Vineyard could ſuffice. With what care muſt theſe Prints immediately be diſperſt into all quarters? not only at the publick Meeting Houſe, the Bookſellers Shops, but ſome of them muſt be ſent up and down in blank Papers to ſeveral Perſons by the Penny-Poſt, and others carry'd to Coffee-Houſes, and openly laid upon the Tables, that every one that comes to take a Pipe and drink a Diſh, might feaſt upon and admire this none-ſuch Author, and not only the ſober, but the wet Drinkers ſhould be baptized into his opinion. Theſe Books (ſuch as they are) muſt be diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all places ſcatter'd, that if it be poſſible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very hand might be furniſht with a tool and weapon to beat and cut us all into pieces: what a ſpirit is this man poſſeſt withal, as if he would be a common troubleſome. Ghoſt; to haunt every houſe and heart, near unto him? Surely we are greatly ingag'd, for our peace, and quiet, (by all lawful means) to do all that we can to lay him; for it is he that hath been the great troubles of our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> I do ſincerely deſire him in the cool time of his ſpirit, provided, when his eyes are opened, he doth ever enjoy ſuch a ſeaſon, ſolemnly to conſider the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the wiſeſt of men doth give of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick annoyer, <hi>Prov. 26.18.</hi> When I firſt caſt mine eyes upon his. Books, I could not but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
<pb facs="tcp:44339:9"/>them for Pride, Ignorance and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, never yet ſaw I any thing ſince I was able to hold a book in my hand for theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications ſo excellent; this hath been the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of many, that have been much more able to judge, than ever he will be to write.</p>
            <p>I ſhall briefly tell you, what was my vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment provocation and prevailing inducement to preach the following Sermons, <hi>vid.</hi> his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious cruelty in his Book, offer'd to our Children, to the Seed of all that have the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular priviledge of being in Covenant with the Lord. He could not in his writings content himſelf (as many of his Brethren do) only to exclude them from their right to Baptiſm, but muſt proceed upon ſuch wayes, and means, that do inevitably ſhut them out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, if ſo be they expire in their infancy, <hi>Hinc illae Lachrymae!</hi> What pious and tender Parent, that hath a ſerious concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon his heart, for the eternal ſtate of his Child, can hear ſuch Doctrine, and his ears not to tingle, and his heart not to tremble?</p>
            <p>I confeſs, to have ſuch wild and cruel Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be not only deliver'd, but lick'd up and admir'd amongſt us (as if it was one of the choiceſt Truths of Grace, that our Lord and Maſter ſends his Ambaſſadors to proclaim) did cauſe a little zeal for Truth to wax warm within me, and engaged me to draw up ſome cautions againſt, and make ſome mild reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:44339:10"/>upon, ſuch Infant-deſtroying matter: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when I preach'd (as the Lord did inable me) concerning a ſound and ſaving knowledge of Chriſt in the uſe of this truth; I did blame ſome that were chiefly concern'd about other knowledge, little reſpecting this; adding, That there was ſuch a knowledge of Chriſt, as to the object of it, but was not that which was moſt neceſſary to Salvation, as for inſtance, that of Baptiſm, as to the ſubject of it. Thus I gently deliver'd my ſelf, ſaying, that there be ſome Pulpits that reek with a blind Zeal againſt Infant-baptiſm; but pray take notice, that what I am going to ſpeak is neither for, nor againſt the baptizing of Infants, only I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but take notice of a Pamphlet, lately riſen up in the midſt of us, that in its decrying In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants-baptiſm, does proceed upon ſuch Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums, that muſt unavoidably ſhut thoſe that dye in their Infancy out of Heaven, and ſo a terrible ſentence of condemnation is denounc'd againſt them all: this bold Writer doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to lay it down as one of his infallible poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that no Infants are in Covenant with their Parents that are Believers, nor capable of habitual Faith, one great branch of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and the new Creature, indiſpenſably neceſſary to Salvation. This he is ſo confident of, that in a ſcornful way, he doth rank that odious Doctrine of Antichriſt, Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, with Infants being in Covenant with
<pb facs="tcp:44339:10"/>their Parents, and their being capable of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Faith; it ſeems they be all of the ſame import with him: He being ſenſible what a foundation he hath laid to build the perdition of Infants upon, that he might lick this ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhapen Monſter into ſome pleaſing ſhape, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us, that he hath found out a way to ſave Children notwithſtanding: One would wonder what this curious invention ſhould be, it is this, <hi>vid.</hi> thoſe Children that ſhall be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhall ſo be by an imputed righteouſneſs; thus we ſee, what it is to be a ſagacious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. I believe all the brains of the dull Schoolmen, could never find out ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite notion, as this topping Preacher hath not only to ſend our poor Infants by ſwarms to Hell, but alſo can recall them and reverſe the doom that he hath denounc'd againſt them; as if the power of Life and Death were in his hands: The worſt of it is, here is nothing to prevail upon us to imbibe his new invented way, but his own Authority; his <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> will not ſatisfie thinking men, tho' it may go ſmoothly down with his own admirers.</p>
            <p>That Caution given to us about falſe Teachers, <hi>Gal. 1.8.</hi> cannot but ſtick with me; I am certain here is another Goſpel, and that in a ſubſtantial point of our Religion, and Articles of Faith. I confeſs (in the hearing of many of you) I did ſay upon this unſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Notion, what I ſee no reaſon as yet to retract that to talk of an imputed Righteouſneſs, without a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, &amp; without an imparted Righteouſneſs, was but Mountebank Divinity. I underſtand it to be
<pb facs="tcp:44339:11"/>the judgment of all our Divines, that Juſtification, and Sanctification, tho' different in their Nature and uſe yet are never ſeparate as to their ſubject; for thoſe whom God doth juſtifie, them alſo he doth ſanctifie, neither do I understand how without a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, we can be made partakers of either of them: but here is an incomparable man, that can divide theſe great bleſſings, and can make Infants happy with one, tho' they are not capable of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ay, and that notwithſtanding they be not in the Covenant of Grace with their Parents. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der where my good neighbour learnt this Doctrine; he is ſuch a Profeſſor of Divinity, as that he hath made a Catechiſm, which he hath diſpers'd among his Diſciples I have not yet ſeen it, but fear, when I ſhall obtain a ſight of it (as now I do intend) I ſhall ſcarce find him more excellent, and ſound, than what was the product of that judicious Aſſembly that ſat at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> alas they could find out no ſuch way as here is preſented unto us, of condemning and abſolving Infants: to mention this Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank Divinity with caution and tenderneſs, was all that I did preſume to do for many years; I thought at this, no well temper'd and ſober mind could ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a recoil, conſidering my long and many provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But what a noiſe did this make? What a dust did this raiſe? Nay, into what a frisk did this put our admir'd Author? How was he nettled? that any of his Doctrine ſhould, (that was much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd by ſuch that were juſt as able to judge, as he to write) be call'd into queſtion: Notwithſtanding all that was ſaid, neither his venerable name, nor either of his Books was ſo much as mention'd, that which was ſpoke, did not carry any direct oppoſition to his Believers Baptiſm (as he calls it;) yet he (as if he was the only Soveraign upon this Spot, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
<pb facs="tcp:44339:11"/>with a deſpotick power, taking upon him to rule as with an abſolute Authority) was put into a terrible commotion and convulſion; and many of his Devotaries were prejudicially poſſeſt, as if ſome great Treaſon had been committed againſt their Ruler and Guide: Why, but what is the matter? A poor man that lay bury'd for ſix or ſeven years in the Grave of patience and ſilence, upon whom they had long trampled, and over whom they had long inſulted, the top-mould of his Grave did a little diſcernibly move, and what ſhall we do, provided there ſhould be a Reſurrection? Oh! how were all hands (tongues) called to help? How muſt the mouth of the grave be diligently watch'd that he creep not forth? leſt our tottering foundation be diſquieted, our high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tower'd magnificent Structure be ſhaken, our dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Principles about dying Infants be detected and diſprov'd, and the fatal Sentence that we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd be revers'd; Little can any one ſuppoſe or conceive what a tumult was rais'd from ſo ſmall an alarm, all muſt be upon the defence; but with what Weapons muſt that be made? Out of what Porge or Mint muſt they come? Surely out of that Infernal One of Hell; that which I muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted withal at the firſt Onſet muſt be Lyes, as if nothing elſe was their Armour of Proof, and Weapons of Deſence. It is wonderful that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe, that would be thought the moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, if not the <hi>only</hi> People of God amongſt us, ſhould themſelves give us their true <hi>Erymology,</hi> and diſcover what <hi>Lineage</hi> and <hi>Stock</hi> they be of, the Lord help them to conſider, who is the Father of Lyers, and whoſe Children they are that make Lyes; Is this conſonant with the deſcription that is given of Gods Children? <hi>Iſa. 63.8. For he ſaid, Surely they are my people, children that
<pb facs="tcp:44339:12"/>will not lie.</hi> Let thoſe that would be thought the greateſt <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> and to have their <hi>Names</hi> wrote in the <hi>Lamb's Book of Life,</hi> be careful they do not deceive and expoſe themſelves by this Sin to a fearful Excluſion, <hi>Rev. 21.27.</hi> I have a <hi>Black Catalogue</hi> of Lyes committed to Writing, which I had thought at this Time to have preſented you withall, but forbear till another ſeaſon. I ſhould have been very glad not to have been concern'd in this controverſie, but ſince I have ſuffer'd ſuch a violent arreſt out of my grave of durance and ſilence, where I ſhould have been glad to have reſted all my dayes, and finding my Pillow to be extreamly uneaſie, being ſtufft with piercing and pricking thorns; I could not but offer this little Teſtimony for the Truth I am contending for. When I did diſcourſe in my Pulpit about the Covenant ſtate of Infants with their Parents, I did not intend that what was deliver'd ſhould ever fall under the weight of the Preſs; what hath been ſpoken hath not been altogether deſtitute of a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing (through grace) unto many that heard it: the next Sabbath after my undertaking in this affair, my good neighbour (that he might ſhew the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of his Spirit) produc'd in his Pulpit a Paper againſt me, which he read in his Congregation, at the tail of which he diſcover'd his ſting, which was an open challenge that he pronounc'd againſt me, to diſpute me openly, either in his, or my Meeting Houſe; thus the Gantlet (I do not ſay the Club) was caſt; the ſame week he did diſperſe abroad that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the next Lords day, he would preach upon my Text, and confute me. I had thought to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted you what an excellent confitter he is (hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his confutation Sermons by me taken from his mouth, by the Pen of a ready Writer:) but upon
<pb facs="tcp:44339:12"/>ſecond thoughts, I ſhall ſuſpend that until another occaſion be offer'd. This Champion that he might triumph, in his moſt triumphant and ſtately Chariot, hath publiſhed another Challenge againſt me in his Pulpit, after he had (as he judg'd) confuted my Doctrine about the Covenant. If it had been any of my Brethren that he had thus confuted and challenged, I ſhould have wondered what manner of Spirit this Man had been of; one would have thought that if he had had any True <hi>Call</hi> to the Miniſtry, (which many queſtion) the conſideration of his Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might have ſomething ſuppreſſed the proud Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Mind, which in theſe Things doth emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently and too apparently diſcover it ſelf, and that he might not have thought himſelf to have been a Star of the Firſt Magnitude. I remember I have read of a King that was advanced to the Throne from a mean Deſcent and Calling, being a Potter by Trade, that the Canker of Pride might not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach nor corrupt the Royal Diadem, would have all his Proviſions for his Table ſerv'd with Earthen Veſſels, that ſo he might frequently have ſuch an Object in his Eye, that might keep him humble. I ſhall leave my good <hi>Friend</hi> and <hi>Antagoniſt</hi> to make the Application. I have oftentimes thought in my grieved and ſorrowful ſilence, that if it had pleaſed the Divine Providence to have placed ſome of my <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> Brethren (whom my Soul loveth dearly) in this Mans <hi>Poſt;</hi> we might have dwelt like Brethren, might have taken ſweet Counſel, and have walked unto the Houſe of God together, yea, might have carried on the Work of the Lord with one Hand, one Shoulder, and one Heart. I can <hi>(Chriſtian Readers)</hi> truly ſay, that what I have here put into your Hands to read in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Sermons</hi> is wrote and deſigned for the
<pb facs="tcp:44339:13"/>Honour of God, the Grace of his Covenant, to interpoſe a little between our poor Children and Little Ones, and that Soul-amazing Doom that is pronounced againſt them, to reprove the raſh and furious Zeal of our <hi>Adverſary,</hi> to Anſwer the vehement Importunities and longing Expectations of many of my good <hi>Friends,</hi> to commode all that hear me, in inſtructing them in this great and comfortable <hi>Truth</hi> of the Goſpel that I contend for, to give a check to that Lying Spirit that is got looſe among us, to ſatisfie any that are ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and doubting about Baptiſm, and to reduce (if the God of Peace ſhall ſee good) this poor troubled Place to a peaceable tranquil Compoſure. Oh! cry to God, that this my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking, ſincerely proſtituted to the good of Souls, may meet with ſome ſuitable Bleſſing thereunto, and that all my poor Labours in the Work of the Goſpel, may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain good ſucceſs. The Lord be with you, and bleſs you, and cauſe his gracious Face to ſhine upon you, guiding you into the Way of Truth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting you to his Eternal Glory: My Hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and prayer for you all is, that you may be ſaved.

            <p>IN this Chapter we have one of the firſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons that was preached after the Aſcenſion of Chriſt. The very firſt that we read of, unleſs we take <hi>Peter</hi> his divine Oration in the Chapter before concerning the apoſtacy of <hi>Judas,</hi> and the chooſing of another in his room to fill up the Number of the Diſciples, to be the firſt. This indeed is a moſt excellent Sermon, and of divine inſpiration, in which the holy Scriptures refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that caſe, were elegantly, and opportunely explicated, and applyed; and the Auditory that he directed himſelf unto ſweetly compoſed, and inſtructed in the Election of another Apoſtle, to fill up the room of him that betrayed his Lord and Maſter, who through the inſufferable anguiſh of his own Conſcience, was a moſt execrable Executioner of himſelf, and by the juſt judgment of God had his bowels burſt out, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We come unto the Chapter which my Text is part
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44339:14"/>of, in which we may obſerve four general parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Miſſion of the Holy Ghoſt upon the Apoſtles, who according to the promiſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt were to wait at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the accompliſhment of that rare and neceſſary bleſſing, to fit them for that great and difficult undertaking of preaching and planting the Goſpel they were commiſſionated unto, who were to go together and not enter upon this great work, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Spirit did reſt upon them. <hi>Ver.</hi> 1: <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we have their obedience to their Lords command, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.13, 14. There is one thing very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that when the Apoſtles, and thoſe that were with them, were with one accord waiting for the fulfilling of the promiſe, they did not ſit dumb, and ſilent together; but they did pour out prayer, and ſupplications to God, they did not keep ſuch a ſilent meeting, waiting for the Spirit, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> pretend to do: They were not only waiting but praying, it may be well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that they were making ſupplications to God, for the obtaining that promiſed mercy they were under the expectation of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Sermon that <hi>Peter</hi> (by divine aſſiſtance) did deliver to the Congregation that was about him. His Auditory was very great; no wonder it was ſo, partly becauſe of the time of it: Here was a great Seaſon that might contract a numerous Aſſembly, it was in the time of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecoſt,</hi> when there was a great reſort of people from many places; and alſo becauſe of that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that was then wrought in the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt upon the Apoſtles, which enabled them to ſpeak in various languages, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. When this extraordinary thing was noiſed abroad, it brought the Multitude together, ſome were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, others were amazed, and there were thoſe that mocked; they thought the Apoſtles were full of New Wine, as if their ſpeaking
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44339:14"/>through the Gift of the holy Spirit ſo miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly poured upon them, was only the fruit and effect of their exceſſive drinking. Thus we may obſerve how Satan doth inſtigate thoſe that be under his conduct and influence, to blaſpheme the moſt wonderful and obvious Works of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7, 8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In this Sermon the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> undertakes two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To wipe off that foul Aſperſion, that was caſt upon them, of being filled with New Wine. It was very needful for him ſo to do, otherwiſe this might be a means to obſtruct the good ſucceſs of his Sermon: We may ſee in many <hi>Verſes</hi> the way the Apoſtle takes to clear them of this Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Accuſation, from <hi>ver.</hi> 14, to 22.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He comes to the peculiar Subject the Spirit of Chriſt did lead him unto, <hi>viz.</hi> To ſet home upon the Conſciences of the <hi>Jews,</hi> their great and ſanguinary Sin in their cruel and malicious crucifying and murdering the Lord Jeſus, the Prince of life, the only Meſſiah and Saviour of the World. Many of thoſe that heard him were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, as we may ſee by the round and poſitive charge, he draws up againſt and faſtens upon them, <hi>verſe</hi> 22, 23. Here we may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, how fully and emphatically the Apoſtle doth fix this Crime upon his Hearers, as to him that was barbarouſly murdered and crucified; therefore he called him <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> to ſhew that he was the true Meſſiah, promiſed by all the Prophets, and that they might readily underſtand that he ſpake of that very <hi>Jeſus,</hi> whom they in ſcorn and contempt called <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> and upon whoſe Croſs they fixed that Title; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to make the charge the more full, he adds that it was that <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> that was a Man approved of God among them by Miracles, Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Signs, which God did by him, and that in the midſt of them, as they themſelves well
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44339:15"/>knew: It was him that they did take, and by wicked hands did crucifie and ſlay. It is to be obſerved, that this terrible Accuſation is exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt all the Auditory of <hi>Peter,</hi> when he ſaith unto all that heard him, Ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and ſlain, he might deliver himſelf thus unto them all, becauſe in ſo great a company, many were preſent that actually poured out the blood of Chriſt: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the whole People cried out at the Tribunal, crucifie him, crucifie him, and imprecated, that his blood might be upon them, and their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>viz.</hi> the guilt of his blood, and the direful fruits of it.</p>
            <p>What a wonderful Spirit of Zeal and Courage, was the Lord pleaſed to fill this Apoſtle withal? Even him, who out of fear ſometime before had denied his Lord and Maſter; he was now full of the Spirit of the Lord, which is a Spirit of might and ſtrength, that did animate and ſupport him. One would think that this bloody Congreſs, that were skilful in, and ſcarce cool from the effuſion of blood, yea of the beſt of blood, would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately have diſpatched him and emptied his Veins.</p>
            <p>That the Apoſtle might faſten their execrable ſin upon their conſciences, in murdering the Meſſiah, he doth (from the Word of God) prove him to be ſo. He did not only propound his aſſertion, but he proved it, that ſo he might involve his hearers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a full and through conviction. This doth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently inſtruct thoſe, that take upon them to preach the truths of Chriſt, to prove them, and to be able to defend them.</p>
            <p>The Suitable mediums and arguments, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle inſiſts upon to prove this his Doctrine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, as how God raiſed him from the dead, and concerning <hi>David</hi> a tipe of him, I muſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44339:15"/>not ſtand to ſhew, but muſt come to the next general part I obſerve in this Chapter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The good effects and gracious fruits of this the Apoſtles Sermon. After he had fixed the charge he drew up againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> for murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Meſſiah, whom he proved to be ſo, then he comes with a ſharp arrow of application, and ſtrikes it deep (by the efficacy of the holy Spirit) into the hearts of his ſinful Auditors, <hi>ver.</hi> 36. <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let all the houſe of Iſrael know aſſuredly, that God hath made the ſame Jeſus whom ye have cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, both Lord and Chriſt:</hi> He told them how emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently he was exalted by God, whom they had vilified and abaſed unto the greateſt contempt and ſhame, and had put him to the moſt painful, ſhameful and curſed death, that ever could be.</p>
            <p>Oh! to deal thus with the Son of God, the Lord of all, the only Meſſiah ſo highly exalted at the right hand of the Majeſty on high, and made both Lord and Chriſt, what a cut might this be to thoſe that heard the Apoſtle, being guilty of ſo great ſin, of ſuch Scarlet impieties? <hi>Tunc ingens eſt ſtimulus, quo Petrus mirâ libertate et ſinceritate, pupugit corda Judaeorum.</hi> See and behold, what wickedneſs ye have committed, the guilt of what blood you have contracted: what maliciouſly and cruelly to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Lord Jeſus, the Saviour of the world, who is the Lord of all, who is over all, God bleſſed for over!</p>
            <p>This had by the bleſſing of the moſt high graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous effects and fruits upon thoſe that heard him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> They were pricked at the heart, they were troubled and grieved at their heart, becauſe of their horrid ſin they had committed in their deteſtable murder of Chriſt. <hi>Doluerunt animis, quod crucifixiſſent Chriſtum.</hi> Piſca. Ver. 37.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They ask <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles, what they ſhould do? <hi>ver.</hi> 37. Now they were brought into a miſerable plunge, the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44339:16"/>bloudy colour of their ſin, and their Conſciences boiling hot within them, pronouncing fiery Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences againſt them, the very ſting of the damned was crucifying them; this might well make them as amazed, and confounded rebels to cry out, what ſhall we do? what courſe ſhall we take, to get free from the charge of this crying ſin? no ſooner were theſe poor wretches convinced, and begged councell of the Apoſtles as to their eſcaping that dreadful wrath that was due unto them for their greatly meritorious ſin; but <hi>Peter</hi> gives them ſuitable advice, directing them how they might obtain eternal Salvation, by the bloud of him whom they had wickedly crucified and ſlain, as in <hi>ver.</hi> 38. he doth exhort and direct them, to repent, to be baptized in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, that they might receive remiſſion of ſin, and the gift of the holy Ghoſt; then they may be well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that through him whom they crucified, they ſhould obtain a diſcharge from their foul-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding guilt, and eternal Salvation. I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further in the parts of this Chapter, neither ſhall I add any thing more as to the happy effects and events of the Apoſtle's moſt excellent Sermon, in the hearts, and lives of theſe wonderful converts, that heard him, who though never ſo wicked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, were the <hi>prinitiae evangelij,</hi> ſhewing the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous efficacy of the ſufferings of Chriſt, that thoſe that were his inveterate enemies, and did ſo inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiably thirſt for his pure and ſpotleſs bloud, that nothing could ſatisfie, but their waſhing their hands in the ſame by a violent effuſion, ſhould partake of the firſt fruits of it.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle diſcerning, what a miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they ſaw themſelves to be in, and into what a direful abiſs of divine wrath they apprehended themſelves to be ſwallowed up, he does not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nakedly call upon them to repent and turn to God, and to fly unto him for mercy; but gives
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44339:16"/>unto them one of the moſt gracious Motives and incouragements thereunto, telling them the promiſe is unto them, and their Children. He did well underſtand, that their horrible ſin did not only extend unto them, but alſo unto their off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring; for they had not only poured out the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred bloud of Chriſt themſelves, but alſo had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved their Children in the guilt of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.25. When <hi>Pilate</hi> had ſaid I am innocent of the bloud of this Perſon, ſee ye to it, then anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the people, and ſaid, his bloud be on us, and our Children. Surely a lively ſenſe of this, made a deep wound in their Conſciences. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and ſupport them in this miſerable plunge, when they could not but ſee the wrath of a juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging God, ready to invade both them, and their Children, they could not but be in a deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable caſe, ſaying, we have eternally deſtroyed and ruined both our ſelves and poſterity: The Apoſtle preſents them with a Plaiſter broad enough for their Sore; <hi>q. d.</hi> well though your ſin be ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and damnable as to your ſelves and little ones, yet repent, and turn to God, and it ſhall be happy both with you, and your Children alſo: for ſaid he, the promiſe is to both, and will reach you, and your dying infants; you ſhall not be caſt out of Covenant, but you, and your little ones ſhall continue in the ſame, that you were in before the actual exhibition, and death of your Saviour, whom ye did impiouſly crucifie and ſlay. Oh what a full breaſt of conſolation was here, from the infinite grace of God expoſed for theſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable creatures to ſuck and hang upon! the very marrow and quinteſſence of the Goſpel is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to them, for their effectual inducement to repent and believe. Here was the fountain open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſin and for uncleanneſs, in which theſe poor trembling ſinners might waſh and bathe their guilty and filthy Souls; theſe were thoſe that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44339:17"/>now look upon him whom they had pierced, and did mourn over him, as one mourneth for his only Son, and they were in bitterneſs for him, as one that is in bitterneſs for his firſt born, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Peter</hi> gave them ſuch a Cordial, that could not but greatly refreſh and comfort them; here he was like to his bleſſed Lord and Maſter, the good <hi>Samaritan</hi> that had compaſſion on him that fell among thieves, and was wounded, who went to him, and bound up his wounds pouring in oyle and wine, that ſo he might both cleanſe and cure.</p>
            <p>Now we come to fix upon the words of our Text: That we may ſee clearly, what is intended in them, let us obſerve a few particulars by way of general diviſion that are comprehended in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To whom this is ſpoken; it was to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were then met together out of many Nations at the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt, ver.</hi> 5. <hi>and there were dwelling at Jeruſalem Jews, devout men out of every nation under heaven.</hi> Some of theſe, nay many of them, were effectually touched at the heart by the penetrating Sermon of <hi>Peter,</hi> or rather by the irreſiſtible compunction of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, cooperating with the preaching of <hi>Peter,</hi> as it was at another time, when this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Apoſtle was preaching, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.44. <hi>While Peter yet ſpake theſe words, the holy Ghoſt fell on all them that heard the word.</hi> When the holy Ghoſt doth fall upon the heart, and into the heart of thoſe that hear; the word then (the power and authority of it) ſhall be found, and that by the moſt perverſe and obſtinate ſinner: it is he that makes the <hi>word to be quick, and powerful, and ſharper than any two-edged ſword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of ſoul and ſpirit, and of the joints and marrow, and to be a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, Heb.</hi> 4.12.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:44339:17"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By whom they were ſpoken; <hi>Viz.</hi> by <hi>Peter,</hi> in the name of all the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. It pleaſed the Lord at this time, and upon this occaſion, to conſtitute him to be the mouth of all, he was great in utterance, it is very probable the reſt of the Apoſtles might be willing to chuſe him to be their Spokeſman. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Spirit of the Lord did order it, that it ſhould be ſo, that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould be the man, that ſhould preach this excellent Sermon, all the Apoſtles were concerned in it, and did even ſpeak in and with him, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>But Peter ſtanding up, with the Eleven, lift up his voice, and ſaid unto them, ye men of Judea, and all ye that dwell at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake in the company, and in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the reſt: thoſe awakened ſinners judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that in the ſpeaking of <hi>Peter,</hi> all were concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, therefore when they were pricked to the heart, they ſaid not only to <hi>Peter,</hi> but to the reſt of the Apoſtles, men, and brethren what ſhall we do? One Miniſter of Chriſt, that ſpeaks the word of God, preacheth in the ſame authority, that all the Miniſters of the Goſpel do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Why theſe words in the text were ſpoken and affirmed; It was by way of Motive to preſs on the exhortation, we have in <hi>ver.</hi> 38. the <hi>Jews</hi> had lived under the former adminiſtration of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, in the which the Meſſiah, that was to come, was exhibited in the promiſe, and ſhadowed in many Types, and Figures, by which they were taught to expect, and to look for the coming of the Meſſiah in Perſon. At laſt in the time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he is come to bring, and to eſtabliſh a new and a more glorious adminiſtration, not to diſſolve the Covenant (as ſome would have it) but to eſtabliſh it under a more eminent, and excellent diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than ever it was before his incarnation, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and aſcenſion. But becauſe he came not with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44339:18"/>external pomp and ſtate, That the carnal <hi>Jews</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected him in, he was by them deſpiſed, rejected, &amp; perſecuted to death, which the infinitely wiſe God did overule to the accompliſhment of his eternal purpoſe, as to the Salvation of the elect; yet their ſin and wickedneſs was never the leſs, who took the bleſſed Son of God, the only Meſſiah, and by wicked hands, did crucifie and ſlay him, though he was delivered by the determinate councel of God: the eternal purpoſe and councel of the everlaſting, and infinitely wiſe God, took place in the <hi>Jews</hi> perpetrating their enmity and malice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our bleſſed redeemer, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.27, 28. <hi>For of a truth againſt thy holy child Jeſus, whom thou haſt anointed both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Iſrael were gathered together, for to do whatſoever thy hand, and thy councel determined before to be done.</hi> Though all was managed, by the adored wiſdom of the eternally wiſe <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who brought his Son into the world, and delivered him up to be crucified; yet the wickedneſs of his implacable murdrers was never the leſs. The Apoſtle finding ſome of their hearts to be bleeding, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting, and greatly affected at their amazing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, he labours to ſet conviction home upon their Conſciences, to drive the nail up to the head, he perſwades them to repentance, and to ſubmit to Chriſt his diſpenſation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and to declare their ſubmiſſion, by their being baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> we are to conſider, what is here affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this is the matter that we are moſt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about, <hi>viz.</hi> this promiſe is to you, and your children. What this promiſe is, imports the Emphaſis of this text; there are two acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I find to be of theſe words, I will mention, both of them.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:44339:18"/>
            <p n="1">1. Some would have the Article <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to point at the Promiſe before-mentioned, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the Prophet <hi>Joel, ver.</hi> 16, 17. <hi>But this is that which was ſpoken by the prophet Joel, and it ſhall come to paſs in the laſt days, (ſaith God) I will pour out of my ſpirit upon all fleſh: and your ſons, and your daughters ſhall propheſie, and your young men ſhall ſee viſions, and your old men ſhall dream dreams.</hi> This (ſay ſome) doth relate to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary effuſion of the Spirit of God, that ſome ſhould enjoy. But I find, that there are Expoſitors, that encline not to this. I ſhall lay down two or three Reaſons, why I judge, that the Promiſe in this Text doth not refer to that of the pouring out of the Spirit in great meaſure.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The interpoſition of a large diſcourſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the mention of that promiſe, and the Text, ſeems to break off all connection, between the diſcourſe concerning the Counſel of God in giving up Chriſt to death, and then to give him a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reſurrection revealed at large in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> which had been now accompliſhed by them, tho' with wicked intentions: This interpoſeth; ſo that here, the Apoſtle ſeems to be upon a new matter, altogether diſtinct from that promiſe of the extraordinary, and plentiful effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe they that did believe, and were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, did not receive theſe extraordinary gifts; therefore it is not to be ſuppoſed, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle would deceive, and delude them, in making ſuch a promiſe unto them, which was not to be performed, and never to be imparted unto them. The holy Preacher did only induce, and ſweetly entice them with a promiſe, which upon their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of his counſel, they might be certain to enjoy: It was indeed a moſt gracious promiſe, ſuch an one, that would make them eternally happy, and more neceſſary than the gifts of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:44339:19"/>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe the promiſe here meant, is of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual duration, at leaſt to be in force in all Ages; for it is extended to as many, as the Lord ſhall call, which doth reach to all Ages, and Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſo is a promiſe that is not limited and reſtrained to ſome Ages, and to ſome Chriſtians, but toucheth and belongeth unto all: Whereſoever God ſhall be pleaſed to call any, the promiſe ſhall be extended to them, and their children; this laid down as a ground-work for the proceedings of grace, in encouraging to believe, and repent, to the end of times, even unto the calling in of all the Elect.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is another acceptation of the Words, which I ſhall take up withal, ſuch a one that I think is built upon better grounds; let us obſerve well the Article <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is ſet before the word <hi>promiſe,</hi> and that may give us a clear light herein, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>This muſt denote ſome great and eminent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that was made to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that they were well acquainted withal: <hi>The promiſe is to you, and to your children,</hi> the promiſe that was made to you, and that is well known to you. This can be looked upon as nothing leſs, then the Covenant of Grace, or one of the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt or top-branches of it; for to them did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Covenant of promiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Who are Iſraelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving the law, and the ſervice of God, and the promiſes.</hi> Let us ſee what they be called in <hi>Acts</hi> 3.25. <hi>Ye are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, ſaying unto Abraham, And in thy ſeed ſhall all the kindred of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> But what was that ſay you, or what Covenant was that? You may ſee it in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.4, 7. <hi>As for me, my covenant is with thee, and thou ſhalt be the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44339:19"/>father of many nations;</hi> or as the words may be read, of multitudes of Nations. He was then but the Father of one Nation, I but God doth here promiſe unto him, that he ſhall be a Father of a multitude of Nations. This muſt needs look unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the many Nations of them, after the Incarnation, Suffering, and Aſcenſion of the Meſſiah, when the Wall of partition was to be broken down, and the Covenant of <hi>Abraham</hi> carried over unto them. <hi>And I will eſtabliſh my covenant between me, and thee, and thy ſeed after thee, in their generations, for an everlaſting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee.</hi> This is the Covenant-promiſe the Apoſtle urgeth upon theſe convinced and awaken'd Sinners, that he might overcome them to repent, and accept of the new adminiſtration of the Covenant; for the promiſe was to them, and to their Children. <hi>Quod illis filios adjungit, pendet ex verbis promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionis; ero Deus tuus, &amp; ſeminis tui poſt te,</hi> Gen. 17.17. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi Deus filios patribus accenſet in adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis gratiâ,</hi> Saith a Learned Expoſitor, and he addeth, <hi>Hic locus abundè refellit</hi> Anabaptiſtas, <hi>qui infantes ex fidelibus genitos à baptiſmo arcent, quaſi non ſint Eccleſiae membra:</hi> This place (ſaith he) doth abundantly confute the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> who drive away the Infants born of godly Parents, as if they were not Members of the Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Promiſe here ſpoke of, muſt be ſuch an one, which gives remiſſion of ſins, and the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt; ſuch an one, that to droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſconſolate Souls, aſſures of pardoning and ſanctifying Grace: <hi>Ver.</hi> 38. <hi>Then Peter ſaid unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you for the remiſſion of ſins, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> This is that Promiſe, that he tells them doth appertain to them, and not to them only, but to their Children alſo. The ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe we have, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, 34, and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44339:20"/>26, 27. It muſt be ſuch a Promiſe, as carries in the womb of it, the offer of pardoning and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Mercy, which is in the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Scope of the Apoſtle is to ſhew, what an Obligation there was lying upon them, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of and to believe in Chriſt freely offered unto them, and not to ſtand out, and be ſhy of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under his new adminiſtration: From hence he argues, <hi>for the promiſe is to you, and your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> We may ſum it up thus, <hi>q. d.</hi> You are the Poſterity of ſuch, whom God accepted, and took into Covenant with himſelf, promiſing to be a God to them, and their Seed, to whom he alſo promiſed, to ſend his Son, by whom this Bleſſing ſhould be confirmed; accordingly this promiſed Seed, the great Promiſe of the Covenant, is come for this very end, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8. <hi>Now I ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt was a miniſter of the circumciſion for the truth of God, to confirm the promiſe made unto the fathers:</hi> To confirm the Covenant, not to diſſolve it; confirm it, to whom? To the <hi>Jews,</hi> and alſo to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> I but, how is this confirmed by Chriſt, if the Children muſt ſince the coming of Chriſt be ſhut out of the Covenant? Oh! what a ſweet allurement was here, to haſten their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of the Apoſtles Exhortation: Oh! (ſaid he) do not you by your infidelity, and diſtruſt of the Grace and Mercy of God, deprive your ſelves of ſuch an inconceivable and ineſtimable Bleſſing and Priviledge: Thus ſaith an Excellent Author.</p>
            <p>So that the Apoſtle lays before them a good encouragement to come to Chriſt, and a firm bottom of hope to found pardon upon their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; becauſe in their Church-eſtate, which was going alſo to be carried over unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they and their Children were under, being in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, and ſtood firmly poſſeſſed of the ſame, which God would make good to them, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44339:20"/>confirm them in; if by their unbelief they did not cut themſelves and their children off. So the Promiſe is the Covenant of Grace, made to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and his Seed, continued hitherto to them, and their Children. Here we may evidently ſee, that the Apoſtle does not undertake to diſſolve the Covenant, nor to cut off the gracious Entail thereof as to the Children, nor ſhut them out of this great Bleſſing, he would eſtabliſh them in; but acquaints theſe vile, and trembling Sinners, that the Promiſe is to them, and their Children.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Queſt. <hi>What is meant by Children?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> By Children is meant the natural Seed, Children after the Fleſh, for the Covenant here is the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Seed. This is that Covenant the Apoſtle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions when he ſaith, <hi>The promiſe is to you, and your children: Viz.</hi> That Covenant which they were well acquainted withal, and valued themſelves highly from. Our Brethren the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> affirm, That <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Seed had only a Covenant of temporal Promiſes, that the natural Seed had no part in the Covenant of Grace, but only the Spiritual, the Followers of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith.</p>
            <p>But we affirm, That by Children here are meant the natural Seed, <gap reason="foreign">

There is an effectual and ſaving Calling, that which appertains to the Elect of God, by which (by the external Call of the Word, and the inward efficacy of the Spirit) they be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Called out of all Sin unto God. To urge a neceſſity of this, without which, no Benefits of the bleſſed Covenant of Promiſe, can be obtained or challenged, is a palpable Error, againſt which there may be many Clouds of Witneſſes produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to teſtifie. In every Age of the Church, and propagation of the Covenant, there have been many Hypocrites, and formal Profeſſors, that have had a ſtanding in the Church, which is a Priviledge of the Covenant, yet had no effectual Calling; ſo it is now, and will be at the coming of Chriſt, when he ſhall find amongſt the Virgins, as many fooliſh, as wiſe: <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.12. <hi>But the children of the kingdom ſhall be caſt out into outer darkneſs: there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> Iſa. 33.14. <hi>The ſinners in Zion are afraid, fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath ſurprized the hypocrites: who among us ſhall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us ſhall dwell with everlaſting burnings?</hi> Hypocrites that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44339:21"/>are in the Church, and externally in Covenant, ſhall poſſeſs the hotteſt place in Hell. Will our Adverſaries that apply the Seal, and take into Covenant their <hi>way,</hi> be ſo bold, as to ſay, that all thoſe they admit to Baptiſm are true Believers, and Goſpel-penitents? Do not many of them prove Apoſtates? And are not many of them caſt out of their Churches, and delivered over to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan? And may they not have cunning Hypocrites among them that enjoy many Priviledges with them, and ſuch as they thought to be effectually Called?</p>
            <p n="2">2. If they ſay that an outward Call be urged, as neceſſary to the obtaining an Intereſt in the Promiſe, then the natural Seed of Believers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy this Calling virtually in and with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, with whom they are confederate, which they are Called to do, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12. Where we have a ſolemn way of the People viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſtanding before the Lord, to enter into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him, and they had their little ones with them, as confederates with their Parents, and ſo part of thoſe that were ſeparated and Called to be the diſtinct People of the Lord, Members of the Church in covenant with him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Anſw.</hi> And what I judge the fulleſt: That that Reſtriction, <hi>As many as the Lord ſhall call,</hi> pertains only to thoſe that are afar off, and hath no reſpect to theſe here ſpoken unto, or to their children: If we conſider, the Apoſtle doth add this, partly to diſcover the glorious Intention of the Grace of God in carrying over the Promiſe and the Covenant of Grace under the new admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were accounted afar off, and alſo to give thoſe he ſpake unto the greater, and the more ample encouragement, to accept of, and cloſe in with his Exhortation, to repent and to believe. As thus, If God will be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44339:22"/>ſo gracious to them that are afar off, as upon their repentance to admit them, and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, into covenant with him; why do ye doubt and fear? Both you and your children are in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him already. They that trouble us with the Duſt of their falſe Gloſſes, to blind the Eyes of the Simple, and to darken clear Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by all means, would have that Clauſe to be applied to all the three Subjects, <hi>viz.</hi> They, their children, and thoſe afar off when Called, then the Promiſe is theirs; but that the Apoſtle mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and reſtraineth this only to thoſe that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far off, I ſhall evince by ſeveral Reaſons, which if ponderouſly thought upon, may give good ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction herein.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Calling of Perſons ſuppoſeth ſuch that are at a diſtance off; therefore it muſt peculiarly and only belong to them that were afar off, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> — In this Channel runs the Stream of Expoſitors, thoſe that be afar off, they mean the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>Jews</hi> that were nigh. Thus the Scripture doth diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Iſa. 57.19. <hi>I create the fruit of the lips; peace, peace to him that is afar off, and to him that is near:</hi> Here is a bleſſed Promiſe of the Grace of God, in reference unto the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that were ſaid to be afar off, in oppoſition to the <hi>Jews</hi> that were nigh. They were nigh to God, and they and their children were in covenant: I but ſaid the Lord, <hi>I will create the fruit of the lips; peace to thoſe that are afar off,</hi> viz. the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> Eph. 2.11, 12, 13, 17. <hi>Wherefore remember that ye being in time paſſed uncircumciſion by that which is called the circumciſion in the fleſh made by hands; that at that time ye were without Chriſt, being aliens from the common-wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the covenants of promiſe, and without God in the world: But now in Chriſt Jeſus, ye who
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44339:22"/>were ſometimes far off, are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt.</hi> This was the ſtate of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they were far off; I but the <hi>Jews</hi> at that time were nigh. <hi>And came, and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh,</hi> viz. the <hi>Jews,</hi> Children of the Covenant, God was their God, and the God of their Children: I but the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were Strangers from the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not in covenant with God, and afar off; they be called, as we ſee in the Scripture, thoſe that be remote and diſtant, and muſt be meant in this Text.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What rational account can be aſſigned, or can any give why the Apoſtle ſhould here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Children, if children here, the Seed of the faithful that be in Covenant, ſhould not be meant of the Gentiles. Thoſe two Members of the diſtinction, you that are nigh, and thoſe that are afar off, would take in all perſons in the world; and <hi>frustra ſit per plura, &amp;c.</hi> the Children of theſe would be found either afar off, or nigh, one of thoſe terms, would have involved them all; the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of the Children muſt be an impertinency, if it were not for ſome other reaſon. There are ſome I know for a ſhift (this bearing hard upon them) will urge that imprecation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.25. but it is improbable, that all that were the hearers of this Sermon, did joyn in that dreadful wiſh, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them were ſtrangers, and lived remote from <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> However the Apoſtle preſſeth them all alike to repent, and to yeild ſubjection to Chriſt, by an argument from the Covenant, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries weight enough with it, though they had never been guilty of that horrid imprecation. This argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Covenant hath been preſſed at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time to prevail upon the <hi>Jews</hi> to the ſame duty of repentance, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19, 20, 25. <hi>Repent ye therefore, and be converted that your ſins may be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44339:23"/>blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord, and he ſhall ſend Jeſus Chriſt which before was preached unto you.</hi> In this verſe he doth incourage them from a promiſe, and obſerve the rare Motive, <hi>ye are the children of the Prophets, and of the Covenant, which God made with our fathers, ſaying unto Abraham, and in thy ſeed ſhall all the kindred of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> This extends to them that were afar off, not only the kindred of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but alſo the kindred of the Gentiles, ſhould partake of the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham, viz.</hi> of the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham. Gal.</hi> 3.14. <hi>That the bleſſing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles,</hi> (the bleſſing of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant through Jeſus Chriſt) whoſe blood was the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Apoſtle doth here fix his argument, in the benefit that will redound unto them, and to their poſterity by their ſubmiſſion to the Goſpel Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration; by this he doth Emphatically preſs them to it. Oh! what an incouraging and cogent Argument doth this Apoſtle (by a divine inſtinct) urge them withall, ſuch a one, that poor awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſouls, ready to ſink into deſperation could not tell how to reject or withſtand. This ſeems to be the genuine ſenſe of it, you are greatly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for ſin, in general, and ſome of you have been guilty of that dreadful ſin, of a malicious pouring out of the incorruptible and ſacred blood of the Son of God, and crucifying the Lord of Glory, therefore have highly deſerved that his blood ſhould be upon your heads, and upon the heads of your Children for ever; and ſince you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of reverencing, killed the Lord of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, you have dreadfully provoked God to turn you out of it for ever; but if after all, you will but ſubmit to him that you have crucified, it ſhall not be ſo, your deſerts though never ſo great
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44339:23"/>and crying, ſhall never be given unto you; but you ſhall ſtill be to the Lord a choſen and a peculiar People, the Church and the People of God; to you and your Children the Promiſe ſhall ſtill continue, and all under a better Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration than ever; becauſe there is now abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance more of grace, and of the Spirit to be pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, you and your Children ſhall have the firſt experience of it. Oh how ſweetly doth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here entice and allure them to accept of the Seaſonable offer made unto them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That interpretation certainly that renders this Argument of the Apoſtle, to the <hi>Jews</hi> (to prevail upon them to the duty exhorted unto) to be a diſcouragement unto them, and to diſhearten them in their ſubmitting to the Goſpel-Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rather than an incouragement, is not to be admitted. That which doth contradict, or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe greatly impede, and obſtruct the deſign of the Apoſtle, muſt not be entertained. What was the deſign of the Apoſtle, but to perſwade theſe poor loſt creatures to accept of Chriſt, and his Adminiſtration that was taking place. Therefore that he might obtain his end (ſaid he) the Promiſe is to you, and your Children, for both were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the blood of Chriſt; and we may ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſuppoſe, theſe weeping bleeding ſinners were not only concerned for themſelves, but for their Children alſo. They might well deliberate in themſelves thus, what will become of us, I and of our miſerable off-ſpring too? Why ſaith the Apoſtle, here is that that may allay all the amazing and confounding tumult of your ſelf-condemning hearts, the Promiſe is to you, and your Children. The Apoſtle did ſee that their Soul-diſeaſe, had ſo ſunk their Spirits, and they were ſo ready to faint, that they wanted the higheſt Cordial that could be poured into them, and without this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44339:24"/>of their Children, it could never have revived them. This was the opening of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable door of hope, in their pinching and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighting valley of <hi>Achor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have wondered ſometimes, how our Friends the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> can ſupport their minds, when they behold their dear dying Infants, ready to expire and to give up the ghoſt; to reſtrain the intereſt of the Children of theſe <hi>Jews</hi> in the Promiſe, to the time of their calling, could not but be a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſcouragement unto them from coming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Adminiſtration, rather than an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That it would have been ſo I ſhall give two Reaſons to prove it.</p>
            <p n="1">1 This would make their exchange to be for the worſe, and not the better; for the Covenant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they were before, did run to them, and their Seed, but this runs otherwiſe to the great diſadvantages of the Children, and the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the Parents. Children by this way of Interpretation are excluded and diſmiſt the Covenant till their call. This could not but have a deep regret upon the hearts of theſe Parents, that were well inſtructed into their Childrens Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-right with them, and did ſo ſtrongly depend upon it as they did.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This would put their Children into the ſame condition, with thoſe afar off, the reſtriction e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually taking hold of the Children of the <hi>Jews,</hi> with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and Heathens yet afar off, which would ſound harſhly in the Ears of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it were ſo, of what import muſt the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be but of this, <hi>Viz.</hi> If ye will now, ye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened trembling <hi>Jews</hi> believe in Chriſt, and come under his Adminiſtration, the Promiſe ſhall continue unto you, but your Children ſhall be cut off and turned out of this priviledge, they ſhall be in the ſame condition of the reſt of the <hi>Pagan</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:44339:24"/>world; when they hereafter, and any of the Heathen ſhall be called, then they may have a part in the ſame Promiſe too, and not till then. This being contained in that Interpretation, whether it would not in the nature of the Argument, rather drive them off, then draw them on, let any impartial perſon judge. Was this a probable way to comfort and ſupport, theſe ſelf-condemned fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to deliver ſuch a heavy meſſage unto them, as to wreſt from out of their boſoms, and to rend all their Children out of the Covenant of grace, and turn them into the herd of thoſe that are afar off, that were out of Covenant, without God and having (remaining in that condition) no hope in the world? <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. This would be but to add affliction to the afflicted, and to caſt a wonderful ſtumbling Block in the way of theſe <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the true and ſound Interpretation gives them choice relief, and removes all impediments out of their way, leaving them no remora to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct or retard the Apoſtles exhortation unto them. The Promiſe is already to you, and to your Children, as you are <hi>Jews,</hi> which Promiſe ſhall be confirmed to you and your Children if you now believe. I the Apoſtle, that he might give them the higheſt incouragements, tells them furthermore, that the Promiſe ſhall be extended to thoſe that are afar off, even to ſo many as the Lord in any part of the world ſhall call, and they, and their Children ſhall partake of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with them. Here is the full breaſt of the Goſpel laid open for to hang upon to ſuck and be ſatisfied; here is the fountain opened, and not only the Parents, but the Children alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited unto it.</p>
            <p>It is a good obſervation, that a learned Man here obſerves (ſaith he) <hi>hic enim Judaei aliis prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feruntur, quia ſunt velut primogeniti in Dei familia,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44339:25"/>imo ſingulari privilegio Segregati, tunc erant a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquis omnibus; ergo legitimum ordinem Petrus obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat, quin Judaeis aſſignat priores honoris partes: Quod illis filios adjungit, pendet ex verbis promiſſionis, Ero Deus tuus, et ſeminis tui poſt te.</hi> Gen. 17.17.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoke thus much to clear up my way for a Doctrine, I come to propound that great truth, that is obviouſly comprehended in this text for our comfort and improvement. There be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed two eminet doctrines in the text, I ſhall name both, but fix only upon one.</p>
            <p>Firſt Doctrine, <hi>That the Children of believing Parents, as ſuch, are taken into Covenant with God with their Parents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Second Doctrine, <hi>the Covenant being made with Believers and their Children, is a very great obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and inducement; to repent and to accept of the new Adminiſtration of the Covenant.</hi> This the Apoſtle doth ſtrongly and aptly urge, upon the convinced <hi>Jews</hi> unto this great duty. But I ſhall not ſtand upon this truth, my buſineſs is with the other.</p>
            <p>This is the Doctrine I would by the help of God treat of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Children of believing Parents, as ſuch, are taken into Covenant with their Parents.</hi> This the Apoſtle poſitively and comfortably aſſerts, the Covenant of Promiſe that is to the Parent, is alſo to the children; they be both involved in one and the ſame gracious Covenant. God doth not take in the Parent, and exclude the child; but he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits both into this bleſſed <hi>holding,</hi> by the golden rod of his grace. This inheritance hath a grant with an irrepealable Intaile, upon the Seed and off-ſpring. Believers and their Seed are in the Covenant of grace with God, by this the Child holds <hi>in capite</hi> from him from whom he doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44339:25"/>This is a Doctrine that is violently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by thoſe that venture ſomething boldly to contract, and reſtrain the Covenant into a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower compaſs, than ever the Grace of God in conſtituting of it intended, by turning (what they can) covenanted Infants into the ſame miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Wild Field, with the Seed of <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Pagans.</hi> But this is very plain to every Eye that will obſerve the Scriptures, that when ever the Lord was pleaſed to enter into a Covenant of Grace with the Parents, he did alſo with the Children, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3. <hi>Now the Lord ſaid unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy fathers houſe, into a land that I ſhall ſhew thee. And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bleſs thee, and make thy name great; and thou ſhalt be a bleſſing. And I will bleſs them that bleſs thee, and curſe them that curſe thee; and in thee ſhall all the families of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> Gen. 17.7. <hi>And I will eſtabliſh my covenant betwixt me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee, in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, for an everlaſting covenant; to be a God unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee.</hi> This is not to laſt for a time, or for an Age only, but for ever, even to the utmoſt point of time, until the Mediator (in whoſe hands this Covenant is) ſhall perfectly accompliſh his Work. <hi>Ver.</hi> 19. <hi>And God ſaid, Sarah thy wife ſhall bear thee a ſon indeed; and thou ſhalt call his name Iſaac: and I will eſtabliſh my co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him for an everlaſting covenant, and with his ſeed after him.</hi> Acts 3.25. <hi>Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, ſaying unto Abraham, And in thy ſeed ſhall all the children of the earth be bleſſed:</hi> viz. All Nations. here we ſee, He was not to be a Covenant-Father only to the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but alſo to thoſe of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> all of them that ſhould be called, and converted unto God, by the preaching of the Goſpel, they were to be impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44339:26"/>in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant, and he was to be their Father, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. <hi>And if ſome of the branches be broken off, and thou being a wild olive-tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakeſt of the root and fatneſs of the olive-tree.</hi> Here muſt be a graffing in, ſuitable to the caſting out or break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off; that cannot be, unleſs the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and their Children (their Spriggs) be graffed in, as the <hi>Jews</hi> and their Children were broken off, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. <hi>That the bleſſing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles (through Jeſus Chriſt;) that we might receive the promiſe of the Spirit:</hi> Viz. The Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> in his Covenant might through Chriſt be brought over unto the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord Jeſus was the great Seed of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and the Mediator of it, and through the offuſion of his Blood this Covenant is conferred upon the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> according to many Evangelical Promiſes, made before the Actual Exhibition and Incarnation of the Son of God, our <hi>Emmanuel, God with us.</hi> Theſe are a few of that Cloud of Witneſſes, that might have been brought to prove this Doctrine; let them ſuffice for the preſent, many more will occur in our Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>In the handling of this Point I would do theſe things.</p>

            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:44339:26"/>
            <p n="1">1. Queſt. <hi>What Covenant are we here to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand to be the Covenant made with</hi> Abraham, <hi>that Believers, and their Seed, are incloſed in together?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is the Covenant of Grace: This is the Promiſe, or Covenant, in our Text, that refers to that in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. It is not a Covenant of Works, (as ſome would have it to be.) Our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> would by all means have this to be a Covenant of Works, or a Covenant only relating to carnal and outward Mercies and Bleſſings, and that, becauſe ſhould this be granted to be a Covenant of Grace, then we have gained the <hi>Point,</hi> as to the Seal of the Covenant, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Infants. Our great <hi>Champion</hi> hath late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laboured extreamly to violate this Text, and to pull down that bleſſed Foundation God hath laid for us to build upon, as to our ſelves and little ones; by his ſo doing, he offered bold attempts to ſubvert many of the choice Texts, that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to this. To promote his Error, and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he would have this in ſubſtance to be the ſame Covenant of Works which the Lord made with <hi>Adam;</hi> but I ſhall have occaſion (though but a poor Piſmire) to meet with this great <hi>Goliah</hi> that hath given me ſeveral Challenges in his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Pulpit, in the hearing of his Magnifying Auditory.</p>
            <p>Methinks, if Men did but with a ſerious and impartial Eye, view that Text that mine refers unto, ſuch is the nature, the tenor, frame, and circumſtances of it, that they durſt not call this into queſtion: But how ready are Men to ſhut their Eyes againſt that Light, that would diſcover unto them ſomething, that they are too tenacious of. It is ſad to ſee how ſome good Men, that would be thought great Admirers of the Grace of God, and yet do ſet themſelves in this place againſt this high Expreſſion of his Grace in his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44339:27"/>Covenant. This is the ſame Covenant of Grace, for the ſubſtance of it, that is now on foot in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> (ſince Chriſt came, and hath ſent down his Holy Spirit to enlighten us into the knowledge of his Grace, which runs through the Covenant, whoſe Blood was the Blood of the Covenant,) made with thoſe Fathers according to the Fleſh, of whom Chriſt came, who is bleſſed for ever.</p>
            <p>Here becauſe my furious Adverſary (right or wrong) will have this to be but a Covenant of Works, or of outward Bleſſings, and will not ſuffer one Drop of the pure, and ſpecial Grace of God in a Covenant-way, provided for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Elect, nor any Emanation of Gods Love to be through this Channel tranſmitted into the World: I ſhall endeavour to prove by ſeveral things, that this is a Covenant of Grace; if we can out make good this, (I judge) we ſhall gain a good <hi>Point,</hi> and drive our Opponent out of one of his ſtrongeſt <hi>Poſts,</hi> and ſhall take that, which he runs to as his impregnable <hi>Fort.</hi> The Lord open our Eyes to ſee the Truth in this great Affair, with this I think a great deal of Building will ſtand or fall.</p>
            <p>I ſhall briefly lay down ſome <hi>Reaſons,</hi> that to me do carry the Matter beyond all doubt, that the Covenant in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. was a Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Reaſon</hi> May be taken from <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Perſon choſen out from the reſt of the World, to partake of this diſtinguiſhing Priviledge. God did appear to him, and did call him to ſuch a great Favour: Thus to take him and his Children, and his Family, into covenant with himſelf, and to make him the Father of the Faithful in all Ages and Generations; What could move the Lord to this, but his naked Love, Mercy, and Grace? This is that which God did do for him,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44339:27"/>Infinite Grace did ſingle him out, for this bleſſed Covenant-work, calling him out from the midſt of a wicked and idolatrous People, and Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.2, 3. <hi>And he ſaid, Men, brethren, and fathers hearken, The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Meſopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran, And ſaid unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I ſhall ſhew thee.</hi> Here we have the Lord ſelecting (through diſcriminating Grace and Goodneſs) this Father from the reſt of the ignorant blind World where he was, and it was that he might confer this honour upon him, and his, in making this Everlaſting Covenant of Grace with them. He that called him out of Grace did it much for this end, and purpoſe, that he might make and eſtabliſh this Covenant of Grace with him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Becauſe of the quality of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, betwixt whom this Covenant was made, let us but conſider the ſtate of Man, when this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was made, and then we may eaſily ſee the quality of thoſe, between whom was made this happy Covenant. Man was not now in his perfect Station, in the which he was ſet down, as he came out of the pure Mint, with a perfect Draught and Impreſſion of the Divine Image upon him; but in an apoſtate ſinful ſtate, and <hi>Abraham</hi> though call'd, and ſanctified, in an imperfect ſtate. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Covenant muſt be made between God and <hi>Abraham,</hi> not as God is a Creatour, and as Men are innocent; thus it was in the Covenant of Works made with <hi>Adam.</hi> But God as gracious, merciful, pardoning Sin through the Blood of the Covenant, and Men as ſinful, vile, indebted to Divine Juſtice, and obnoxious to the Wrath of God. If <hi>Abraham</hi> had been as perfect as <hi>Adam</hi> was, when the Lord made a Covenant of Works with him, then we ſhould have ſome ground to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44339:28"/>give heed to thoſe, that would have this to be a Covenant of Works. I demand of my Opponent, where God made a Covenant of Works with his Redeemed People, ſince the Fall of Man? As God ever dealt with his People in a Covenant-way, ſince the Fall, ſo they are capable of no other way, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.5, 6, 8. <hi>None eye pitied thee, to do any of theſe things unto thee, to have compaſſion upon thee; but when thou waſt caſt out in the open field, to the loathing of thy perſon, in the day that thou waſt born. And when I paſſed by thee, and ſaw thee pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted in thy blood, I ſaid unto thee when thou waſt in thy blood, Live: yea, I ſaid unto thee when thou waſt in thy blood, Live. Now when I paſſed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of love, and I ſpread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedneſs: yea, I ſware unto thee, and entred into a covenant with thee, thou becameſt mine.</hi> What Covenant can it be, but a Covenant of Grace, that ſuch polluted Creatures can be taken into? And thus it was with <hi>Abraham,</hi> when God found, called him, appeared unto, and enter'd into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Becauſe of the matter promiſed here unto <hi>Abraham</hi> in this Covenant; God doth promiſe to be a God to him, and to his Seed after him for ever. Oh! this is the great matter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed on Gods part; this holds forth more than a Legal Covenant; Is there a more gracious, and a more comprehenſive Promiſe, and fuller of the Grace of God, in all the <hi>Book</hi> of God, than this? Here the Lord doth give, and make over himſelf, yea all his glorious Attributes, Names, Titles, Grace, Love, all Temporal, Spiritual and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Bleſſings; here God doth give himſelf, the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghoſt, the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, and all the <hi>Perſons,</hi> the Godhead with all the Attributes of that Nature, and all the Offices of thoſe <hi>Perſons:</hi> Thus ſaith Judicious
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44339:28"/>
               <hi>Cotton</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe</hi> upon the Covenant, <hi>The Lord through this Covenant gives himſelf, and all his, to his covenanted People through all the Generations of the World.</hi> I would willingly underſtand what may be the reaſon (if there can be any given) when this Excellent Promiſe is repeated in many other places of Scripture, that it is allow'd to be of Grace, and not here, notwithſtanding (if I miſtake not) when this Promiſe is inſerted in other places, it is often taken from this, <hi>Jer.</hi> 24.7. and 31.33. and 32.38. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.20. and 34.24, 31. and 36.38. and 37.27. Here we have the ſame Promiſe, and full of Grace, and why not in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. Oh! there would be great ground of fear, ſhould this be granted; for then the Seal of the Covenant muſt follow, as we ſhall ſee in the cloſe of this Diſcourſe. This is that Covenant that Believers and their Seed be under, ſince the Aſcenſion of the Meſſiah, and that we may clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcern it, God is pleaſed to uſe the old Phraſe and Form of the Promiſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. The ſame Language and Dialect, we have ſpeaking of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> Priviledges and Glorious State, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.3. <hi>And I heard a voice out of heaven, ſaying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he ſhall dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf ſhall be with them, and be their God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is the other Branch of the Promiſe here, that we muſt by the Rule of Relatives underſtand. If God doth give himſelf to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, then he takes them, and chuſeth them to be his People, and Portion for ever; when the Lord is pleaſed to ſay, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed,</hi> this muſt reeds be involv'd, <hi>thou and thy ſeed ſhall be my people for ever;</hi> and ſo it is relatively expreſt often in the Covenant-Language: Now I pray, is not all this of pure Grace?</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:44339:29"/>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> This is a Covenant made in the Hands of Chriſt the Mediatour, and it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in him, the great Seed of the Covenant, and the Head and Foundation of all thoſe that God doth take into Covenant with him. This Covenant was ratified and confirm'd by the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy and Blood of the Mediatour, otherwiſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abraham</hi> nor <hi>Iſaac</hi> could have been ſaved; and hence the Blood of Chriſt is called the Blood of the Everlaſting Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20. <hi>Now the God of peace who brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the great ſheperd of the ſheep, through the blood of the everlaſting covenant,</hi> &amp;c. God in making this Covenant had reſpect to the efficacious and meritorious Blood of his Son, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he could never have made ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe here, of being ſuch a gracious God to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and his Seed for ever. It is judiciouſly ſaid of a Learned Authour, that in this Covenant the Lord taketh the chiefeſt of the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt) to be the Mediatour and Surety of it, and ſo through him are all the Promiſes and Bleſſings of the Covenant convey'd unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, (his faithful Seed) all the World over; therefore he is called the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour of a better Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. and 8.6. And as it was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed in the Hands of Chriſt, ſo when it was tranſlated unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> it was by, and through him, and confirmed unto them by him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. <hi>That the bleſſing of Abraham may come on the Gentiles (through Jeſus Chriſt;) that we might receive the promiſe of the Spirit through faith.</hi> The Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham, viz.</hi> the Covenant of <hi>Abraham:</hi> Rom. 15.8. <hi>Now I ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt was a miniſter of the circumciſion for the truth of God, to confirm the promiſes made unto the fathers.</hi> He was the Miniſter of Circumciſion, the great Inſtructer of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and did firſt confirm the Covenant to them, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44339:29"/>then to the <hi>Gentiles. Ver.</hi> 9. <hi>And that the Gentiles might glorifie God for his mercy;</hi> viz. for the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God through Chriſt, by and through whom, the bleſſed Covenant was confirmed unto them. So that we may ſee, that Chriſt was the Mediatour of this Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed; witneſs thoſe many Types of Chriſt which were annexed unto it, <hi>viz.</hi> Their expiatory and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory Sacrifices injoined the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in caſe of Sin; alſo the two Goats, one for a Sin-offering for the whole Congregation, and the other the Scape-goat, over which all the Sins of the <hi>Children of Iſrael</hi> were to be confeſs'd by the Prieſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Becauſe this is a Covenant that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holds out, and offers pardon of Sin without Works; therefore then it cannot be a Covenant of Works. It holds out pardon of Sin freely, by believing in Chriſt. The Covenant of Works (we know) holds forth no pardon of Sin, no Mercy to Tranſgreſſors that violate and break the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt point of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. I, but this Covenant doth, it holds out pardon of Sin to the vileſt and worſt of Sinners, to thoſe that did barbarouſly and maliciouſly pour out the Blood of the Mediator of this Covenant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.37, 38, 39. This is a Covenant that did freely offer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and pardon of Sin, without the Works of the Law. <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf through this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, by believing in the Mediatour and Teſtator of it, was juſtified and pardoned; read <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That muſt ſurely be a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, that brings in remiſſion of Sin, and Juſtification by Chriſt, through Faith: God did promiſe to be a God to him, and his Seed, a God to pardon.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Becauſe of that Seal the Lord did command to be affixed to this Covenant, which was Circumciſion; Who can deny, but that the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44339:30"/>Lord did command this Seal, Sign, or Token, to be ſet to the Covenant to confirm and eſtabliſh it? <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. <hi>This is my covenant, which ye ſhall keep between me, and you, and thy ſeed after thee; Every man-child among you ſhall be circumciſed.</hi> This God did Inſtitute, as the Initiating Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; by this they were to enter, as viſible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons into this Covenant, or to be viſibly diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and own'd ſuch that were in covenant with God, and in a covenant way devoted and given up unto him. Let me here ask this Queſtion, Did not this Seal of the Covenant denote, that that Covenant it did appertain unto, to be a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace? It is next to a Prodigy to me, that any ſhould Aſſert, that the Covenant that God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> was a Covenant of Works, and yet Circumciſion was the Seal of it, for ſo it is expreſly commanded of God to be, as we have ſeen. Did we ever read of this Seal amx'd to the Covenant of Works? No; in the perfect ſtate that Man was in, when God enter'd into a Covenant of Works, there was no need of, nor occaſion for this Sacrament or Seal.</p>
            <p>Let us but a little conſider the Uſes and Words of this Seal, and we may ſee, that that muſt be a Covenant of Grace, to which it is affix'd as a Seal; for either it holds forth our need of Grace, or the merciful proviſion of Grace prepared for us. I ſhall only mention a very few Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This doth intimate unto us, that vile pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted State of Sin, that we were conceived and tranſmitted into the World in. This may give us the knowledge of our undone State by Nature, how God may loath, and abhor us for ever. The cutting off of the Fore-skin of the Fleſh, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the filthineſs of our Fleſh, and how by Sin we have forfeited our ſelves, and all into the hands of Juſtice, that we be filthy and guilty Sinners.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:44339:30"/>
            <p n="2">2. This ſets forth the gracious Purpoſes and Intentions of a merciful God, to waſh, and to cleanſe, and to ſanctifie us by his Grace, and by the Blood of Sprinkling: The Blood that did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the circumciſing Inſtrument did clearly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that therefore cleanſing and ſanctification are ſet forth by Spiritual Circumciſion. When God doth graciouſly promiſe to waſh and to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie, he doth promiſe to circumciſe the Heart, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. <hi>And the Lord thy God will circumciſe thy heart, and the heart of thy ſeed, to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, that thou mayſt live.</hi> Col. 2.11. <hi>In whom alſo ye are circumciſed with the circumciſion made without hands, in putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh, by the circumciſion of Chriſt:</hi> viz. By the Sanctification of the Blood and Spirit of Chriſt. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. <hi>For we are the circumciſion, which worſhip God in the ſpirit:</hi> We have the inward Spiritual Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the Heart, which was graciouſly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by that Seal of the Grace of God belonging to that Covenant of Grace, the Lord was pleas'd to make with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To denote, and ſet forth, the need we have of the Blood of Chriſt to juſtifie us, and that God would juſtifie us through his Blood. And this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> had a ſpecial eye unto, and his Faith was firmly fix'd upon, after God had made this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him and his Seed, and fix'd this ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Seal unto it. This might be evidenced by many Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1, 2. In many <hi>Verſes</hi> in that <hi>Chapter;</hi> therefore it is that Circumciſion is called, <hi>a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith, of that righteouſneſs that is apprehended, received, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by faith;</hi> certainly then that Covenant that hath ſuch a ſignificant gracious Seal added unto it, can be nothing leſs, or elſe, than a Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:44339:31"/>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> To prove that this was a Covenant of Grace may be the great Reſult and Period of it, which is no leſs than <hi>Heaven;</hi> this is obviouſly implied, in the comprehenſiveneſs of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe we have here, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>I will be a God unto thee; and unto thy ſeed after thee;</hi> I will be a God unto thee, and all thine Elect Seed for ever; I will be a God to love thee, to provide for thee, to be with thee, and with my ſelf eternally to reward thee. How vain, and frivolous is our <hi>Challenger,</hi> in Aſſerting that this Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> was not a Covenant of Grace? Becauſe the great Promiſes of it were outward Bleſſings, and the greateſt of all was the <hi>Land of Promiſe, (Canaan.)</hi> What, is not that a greater Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, for God to promiſe himſelf to be a God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed? Is not an Infinitely Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and Bleſſed God, better than <hi>Canaan,</hi> than all the <hi>Canaans</hi> and Paradiſes in the World, yea, than thouſands of Worlds? But further to ſee the ignorance of this Man in the Scripture, and in ſuch Expreſſions, which denote a higher good intended by God, than what they themſelves may import; as this Promiſe is explained in the <hi>New Teſtament:</hi> When God did make the Promiſe of an Earthly <hi>Canaan</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, he did ultimately intend a better Land than this, <hi>viz.</hi> an Heavenly one; when the Lord doth promiſe this <hi>Canaan;</hi> he doth promiſe Heaven, which this was a Type of; the main thing and good, that the Lord deſign'd for his People, by this Promiſe, was Heaven, and that they ſhould be eternally ſaved. <hi>Abraham</hi> did ſo underſtand it, and others of the Fathers, and ſo ſet their Hearts upon, and rais'd up an Expectation of that bleſſed City and Country that was above; that what they had here were but dark Shadows, and cloudy Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of what was to come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.10, 13, 14, 15, 16.</p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:44339:31"/>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> To prove that the Covenant made here with <hi>Abraham,</hi> was a Covenant of Grace, is <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe of that Obedience, the Lord did both require and accept at the hands of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in this Covenant. There was Obedience, and there was Service, that the Lord did command, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from <hi>Abraham;</hi> this will determine, whether this be a Covenant of Works, or of Grace. If it be a Covenant of Works, it requires nothing leſs than perfect Obedience, nothing ſhort of it will or can be accepted therein, as it was in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with <hi>Adam; Do this and live.</hi> I, but now here in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant, the Lord doth call for, and accept of ſincere and upright Obedience, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1, 2. <hi>And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to him, and ſaid, I am the Almighty God; walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and be thou perfect.</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> right or ſincere.) <hi>And I will make my covenant betwixt me and thee.</hi> Every one knows, that though <hi>Abraham</hi> for Grace, and walking with and obeying God, was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Man; yet he was not a ſinleſs, perfect Man; he had the perfection of ſincerity, but not a ſinleſs perfection, ſuch an one as <hi>Adam</hi> had in Innocency. In this Covenant, <hi>Abraham</hi> did walk before God, he did pleaſe God, and he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by God in vertue of this Covenant, which could never have been, had it not been a Covenant of Grace, that had Chriſt to be the Mediatour of it, in whom he believed and found acceptance.</p>
            <p>Thus Beloved, I promiſe my ſelf, that I have given you ſuch Reaſons, to prove that this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was of Grace, (which the Lord made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed for an Everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,) as cannot well be denied.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Queſt. <hi>Whether ſome only, or all the Children of Believers, are in this Covenant of Grace, with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44339:32"/>their Parents? Whether this Covenant doth incloſe, and impale them all or not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> All they that are the Seed of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, the Lord takes into this Covenant with their Parents: God doth not take ſome, or many, but all; they be all in Covenant with the Lord, until they eject themſelves. When the Lord made this Covenant, and took <hi>Abraham</hi> into it, he took all his Seed with him. <hi>Cain</hi> was in covenant as well as <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> as well as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> though ſome have from Electing Love, and Special Grace, a greater Bleſſing from the Covenant than others, as you will ſee preſently. This Covenant runs to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed, and to his Seeds Seed. Let not us curtail, and contract Gods Covenant, and confine it to narrower bounds than ever the Lord deſign'd. There be ſome Men that talk great Words of the Grace of God, and yet in the mean time, are great Enemies to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſneſs, and amplitude of it largely expreſſed in his Covenant.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Queſt. <hi>Some may ſay, How can that he, that the natural Seed of ſuch that be in covenant, ſhould be in covenant too? Do not we ſee by ſad experience, that many of the Children of pious Parents, prove very profane, and wicked? What do you hold falling from Grace? Here is a Rock that many miſtaken Perſons do ſplit themſelves upon, in reſpect of falling into Errour in this Affair, and many through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance do ſtumble upon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> More generally we muſt know, that as to the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> there are two ſorts of them, though both in corenant. There is a Seed according to the Fleſh, a carnal Off-ſpring and Generation; and they were the Seed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and did highly value themſelves upon
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44339:32"/>this, and boaſted much upon it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.9. <hi>And think not to ſay within your ſelves, We have Abraham to be our father.</hi> Bear not too much upon this; think not that this will excuſe you, you may be the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet Enemies to the Meſſiah; for it was the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that did hate, perſecute, crucifie, and ſlay him, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. So there is a Seed after the Spirit, that be pious and holy, and walk in the Steps of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in the Paths of the Faith of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a double Paternity, there is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting <hi>Abraham,</hi> and a believing <hi>Abraham;</hi> ſo there is a twofold Sonſhip, Children according to the Fleſh, and Heirs according to the Promiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6, 7, 8. <hi>Not as though the word of God had taken none effect. For they are not all Iſrael, which are of Iſrael: Neither becauſe they are the ſeed of Abraham, are they all children: but in Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called. That is, They which are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the fleſh, theſe are not the children of God: but the children of the promiſe are counted for the ſeed. Viz.</hi> In ſhort, though all that be in covenant are Children in a proper ſenſe, yet all are not the Spiritual Seed; for we ſee here, that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Spiritual are called the Seed of <hi>Abraham, ver.</hi> 7. yet do not all walk in the Steps of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> nor partake of the ſpecial Grace that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> did. The Apoſtle doth here tell us, that we muſt not think, that the word of God had taken no effect, becauſe not all, nay not (compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catively) many that are the Seed, the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> did believe, and embrace it; therefore he doth diſtinguiſh of the Seed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> them that be under the Purpoſe of God to Salvation, and are choſen to Eternal Life, they do, and ſhall believe, and become the holy, the ſpiritual, and peculiar Seed. <hi>Abraham</hi> had two Sons, <hi>Iſhmact</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and both taken into co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44339:33"/>I, but the Line of Election was to run through the Lines of <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That we may ſomething more fully open this Matter to your ſatisfactions, and that you may rightly underſtand, how any may be ſaid to be in this Covenant of Grace, and yet in a State of Nature, and in the Firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> I ſhall diſtinguiſh herein, this well underſtood would contribute greatly to put an end to this Controverſie. Some may ſay the Covenant is full of gracious Promiſes, and what right can any have unto the ſame, that be but the natural Seed? Are they Promiſes of ſaving Grace, or outward Priviledges, or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Mercies? Or what are they? How is this to be underſtood, that the Promiſe is to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of thoſe that are in covenant, if by Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are meant the natural Seed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> By Promiſe, I underſtand the Covenant of Grace (as I have ſaid) call'd alſo the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Promiſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. and becauſe of this, they that be in it are called the Children of the Promiſes: Now the Promiſe, or the Covenant, is taken two ways; and ſo there are two ways of being in the Covenant.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Strictly,</hi> And that which Divines call <hi>Foedus Internum,</hi> or <hi>Pars Foederis Interna,</hi> the Internal Covenant, or the ſpiritual part of the Covenant, that which doth contain Promiſes of ſpiritual Bleſſings, and ſaving Graces, ſuch as Juſtification, Reconciliation; Regeneration, Adoption, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevetance, and Glorification, or Eternal Life; and hence we read, that God will give a new Heart, that he will take away the Stony Heart out of the Fleſh, and will give a Heart of Fleſh, that he will circumeiſe the Heart to love, and fear him, that he will write his Law in their Hearts, and they ſhall never depart from him, that he will ſprinke clean Water upon them, and they ſhall be clean, and from all their filthineſs and Idols
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44339:33"/>will he cleanſe them, that he will blot out all their Iniquities, and caſt their Sins into the depth of the Sea, and remember them no more. This is the Internal, and ſpiritual part of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Theſe be the Excellent Promiſes of Special Grace, that God will accompliſh and fulfil to all the Elect, both Adult, and Infants that die in their Infancy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sometimes it is taken more largely, which Divines call <hi>Foedus Externum,</hi> or <hi>Pars Foederis Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terna,</hi> the External Covenant, or the External part of the Covenant, they being both in truth, but Branches of one and the ſame Covenant. This External Part contains Promiſes of many choice Mercies, and Priviledges, which God out of the bounty of his Grace, beſtows upon People that be in covenant with him, which he does not beſtow upon the reſt of the World, which be not taken into covenant with him. One may be in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and partake of many precious and eminent Promiſes; and yet have no ſaving and ſpecial Grace, or Intereſt in God. So it was with a Multitude of the <hi>Jews,</hi> yea, with the greateſt part of them, and that when our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himſelf was amongſt, and converſed with them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. <hi>For he is not a Jew, that is one outwardly; neither is that circumciſion, which is outward in the fleſh: But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumciſion is that of the heart, in the ſpirit, and not in the letter, whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God. Viz.</hi> He is not internally, and ſavingly a <hi>Jew,</hi> he is but only an external one, partaking of the external Bleſſings of the Covenant, injoying the circumciſion of the Fleſh, not that of the Spirit. When our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was in the Fleſh, he had much to do with ſuch <hi>Jews,</hi> that boaſted themſelves of their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Priviledges, which were great; but neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the internal part of the Covenant, which
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44339:34"/>he did caution them againſt; but did not ſhut them out of the Covenant, but left them as he found them.</p>
            <p>This I know is a diſtinction though never ſo ſolid and ſound; yet the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> will not take it down: Notwithſtanding, I know not how they themſelves can ſubſiſt without it, in their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-way. They take into the Covenant, and affix the Seal of the Covenant to thoſe that be Adult, profeſs their Faith in, and Obedience to Chriſt, and their repentance and renouncing their Infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſm, if they have had any. I, but here is the Queſtion, Are all that do ſo, internally and ſavingly in covenant with the Lord? Dare they be ſo bold as to ſay ſo? If they dare, I ſhall offer two things unto them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is againſt the plain and evident Truth of the Word of God. Is not the Viſible Church otherwiſe repreſented in the Scriptures unto us? what are all their <hi>Iſrael</hi> of the peculiar Seed of <hi>Iſaac?</hi> Is this agreeable to the Parables of the Tares, of the Net, of the Wedding, of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and of the variety of the Veſſels in the Church Viſible, and in the Houſe of God? Theſe things are ſo well known to all that read, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what they read, that I need not ſtand upon them. The Lord Jeſus in his little Church, and Family, had one Devil: They be happy Churches indeed, in whom there are no Hypocrites; and from which never any do fall off, and prove A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates. Oh how many out of the pureſt Churches ſhall encreaſe the number of the Damn'd!</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is againſt too great experiences. How many have we ſeen to turn out of the way of Truth into Errour? Many that after they have ſeemed to be waſht from their Sins, and have eſcaped the Pollutions that are in the World through Luſt, by the Knowledge of our Lord
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44339:34"/>and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, are again intangled, and turn'd with the Dog unto the Vomit, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22. How many be there, that the unclean Spirit doth but go out of, and after returns again, and takes a greater poſſeſſion than ever? So that the laſt end is worſe than the beginning, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.43, 44, 45. Let me apply my ſelf unto you, my Brethren of the <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> Perſwaſion; Have you no Revolters among you? None that fall from Truth to Errour, from Strictneſs to Looſeneſs, from an outward holy Converſation to Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Have you never any occaſion to exert your Authority in Excommunication? Have you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any rotten Members to cut off? I am miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, if my good Neighbour be not ſomething good and frequent at this Work, after he hath laid his Hands upon his Converts, and rebaptized Proſelytes, no wonder when we conſider his nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and eaſie Admiſſions. But what I do ſpeak of one, that is but the Head of an overgrown <hi>Schiſme,</hi> (his Church, as it is called,) declared to be ſo, not only by Congegrational, but alſo by <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtical</hi> Elders. When the Anti-paedobaptiſts admit any to the Seals of Church, and Covenant-Fellowſhip, is it not poſſible that ſome falſe Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren may creep in unawares? <hi>Jude</hi> 4. Some Wolves get into Sheeps-cloathing, and they be lookt upon to be the covenant-People of God; this is undeniable, and their revolt proves them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have none of the ſaving ſpecial Gifts and Graces of the ſame; but at beſt were only exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in covenant. You will not pretend to put Seals to Blanks; but you will ſay, They did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to us to be ſo, and ſo, and to be in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. For my part, I muſt ſay, though I deſire to be very careful in my Admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, yet I have as great a hope, and as much confidence, about the Salvation of Infants in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, dying in their Infancy, as I
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44339:35"/>have in any that I do admit. Here I may reto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2+ letters">
                  <desc>••…</desc>
               </gap> upon my Brethren, (becauſe many of your Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that you have taken into covenant, unto whom you have affixed the Seal, do fall off.) Do you hold falling from Grace? So that this may be as well objected againſt you, in your Adult Perſons; as againſt us in our Infants.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Queſt. <hi>If it be granted, That Children with their Parents be taken into covenant, even the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Seed of believing Parents; yet you ſay, they are but External Priviledges, and Benefits, that many of them do partake of, and a great number of them fall ſhort of the Spiritual and Eternal Advantages of the ſame: Therefore, what do they obtain thereby, ſeeing he is not a</hi> Jew <hi>that is one outwardly,</hi> &amp;c.? <hi>What profit did</hi> Cain <hi>reap by being circumciſed, or</hi> Iſhmael? For <hi>(as the Apoſtle ſaith)</hi> circumciſion verily profiteth, if thou keep the law; but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumciſion is made uncircumciſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.25. Behold the days come, ſaith the Lord, that I will puniſh all them which are circumciſed with the uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.25.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They have great Advantages more than others have, that are not ſo much as externally in covenant; I will refer you to the Apoſtle, who propounded and anſwered this Queſtion for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He had ſaid in the cloſe of the <hi>Chapter</hi> before, to cut off the vain confidence of thoſe that did ſecurely repoſe themſelves in their External Priviledges, that he was not a <hi>Jew,</hi> that was one outwardly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He was very ſenſible what Objection ſome would make at that time, therefore he propounds this Queſtion, and returns a free Anſwer, <hi>What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumciſion?</hi> I Anſwer with the Apoſtle, firſt generally, <hi>Much every way;</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:44339:35"/>and then particularly, <hi>chiefly, becauſe unto them were committed the oracles of God,</hi> &amp;c. Thus ſay ſome, You ſtand ſtifly to this, that Children be in covenant with their Parents, and God hath taken them into covenant with them, but what are they the better for it? What advantage doth accrue unto them from thence? I Anſwer, <hi>Much every way.</hi> Methinks the Spirit of God foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how the Covenant, and the Infant-right in it, would be infringed, and invaded in the Times of the Goſpel, did inſpire the Apoſtle here to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict, and oppoſe thoſe bold Uſurpers, that ſhould attempt to make Breaches upon the Lords ſacred Incloſure. I could ſhew in many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars the wonderful advantage that thoſe have, that are but externally in covenant, above thoſe that are not, and what an ineſtimable Favour and Bleſſing it is to be within the Pale of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. I ſhall mention ſome of the chief Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that ſuch do enjoy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They have the Excellent Oracles of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited among them, and committed unto them; this was the Priviledge of the <hi>Jews in propatulo,</hi> and their great advantage, which did diſtinguiſh them from the reſt of the World, and repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to all Nations to be a peculiarly happy and dignified People, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Much every way: chiefly, becauſe unto them were commited the oracles of God.</hi> This the Lord himſelf declares to be one of their ſingular Prerogatives, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.8. <hi>And what nation is there ſo great, that hath ſtatutes and judgements ſo righteous, as all this law which I ſet before you this day?</hi> Pſal. 147.19, 20. <hi>He ſheweth his word unto Jacob, his ſtatutes and judgements unto Iſrael. He hath not dealt ſo with any nation: as for his judgements, they have not known them.</hi> Therefore from the ſenſe of this wonderful Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> cries out, <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord.</hi> To have the cuſtody of Gods Ordinances, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44339:36"/>the uſe of them, the Word, Sacraments, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Miniſtry, Paſtors after Gods own Heart, and all the Service of God. Who can expreſs or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, how happy the People are, that have ſuch Depoſitions, and are ſo diſtinguiſh'd, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify'd, as to have the Means of Grace, in and by which they may come to know and learn the Mind of God; to have Ordinances, wherein they may draw nigh to God; to have a Memberſhip and viſible Standing in that Society, where Salvation is ordinarily diſpenſed, <hi>John</hi> 4.22. <hi>For ſalvation is of the Jews.</hi> There were the Means, and no where elſe, not among the <hi>Samaritans;</hi> hence the Law was called <hi>the inheritance of the congregation of</hi> Jacob, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.4. Certainly thoſe that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in any competent meaſure, the Excellency of this Priviledge, cannot but adore, and admire God in it, and magnifie his Name for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such that be but outwardly in covenant are part of, and go to make up the <hi>Vineyard</hi> of the Lord, they be planted in the Lords <hi>Vineyard,</hi> they be part of the <hi>Garden</hi> of the Lord, hedg'd in, and ſeparated from the reſt of the World, and God doth own them to be ſo. It is no ſmall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to be within the Pale of the Church, and to have a fix'd Standing in <hi>Zion,</hi> Iſa. 5.7. <hi>For the vineyard of the Lord of hoſts is the houſe of Iſrael, and the men of Judah his pleaſant plant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. They have the Propoſals and the Offers of the higheſt Mercy, they live under the Overtures of the richeſt Grace, they be in the Kingdom, and are the Children of the Kingdom; therefore have the higheſt Tenders, and the choiceſt Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to the beſt of Mercies. They are in the Kingdom, and Salvation is nigh unto them, the Boſom and the Arms of Grace and Love are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways before their Eyes, and ready to receive and embrace them. After the Days of the Meſſiah, the <hi>Jews</hi> being in covenant with God, their
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44339:36"/>happy Eſtate was not to be overlook'd, but to be honourably reſpected, therefore they had the firſt offer of Life, and Salvation by Chriſt after his Aſcenſion. So it was in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and in other places, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.25, 26. <hi>Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, ſaying unto Abraham, And in thy ſeed ſhall all the kindreds of the earth be bleſſed. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you firſt, God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to bleſs you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.</hi> They were yet in covenant, and the Lords <hi>Vineyard,</hi> and had this precious Tender of Chriſt, and Salvation by him, ſent unto them to bring them to Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, before it was ſent unto the poor out-caſt <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Acts 13.46. <hi>Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and ſaid, It was neceſſary that the word of God ſhould have firſt been ſpoken unto you: but ſeeing ye put it from you, and judge your ſelves unworthy of everlaſting life, lo, we turn to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. Paul</hi> the great Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did not betake himſelf to them, till his Embaſſy was rejected by the <hi>Jews,</hi> unto whom he was to make his Application. Our gracious Lord when he gave Commiſſion to his Apoſtles; to Preach Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and Remiſſion of Sins in his Name, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that they ſhould begin at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Oh! how was his Heart upon his Covenant-people, and how unwilling was he, that their Covenant-State ſhould expire; therefore he waited upon them to the utmoſt period of the time, ſet for the Patience of God to attend them. Oh! Go, ſaid he, break up, and execute your Commiſſion in that bloody City, ſee if they will Repent and Believe, that I may not lay them waſt. The <hi>Jews</hi> (as is well obſerved by one) had a double Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge before Chriſt came; they were <hi>[Soli,]</hi> they were <hi>alone,</hi> they were the only Church and People of the Lord and incloſed from all the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44339:37"/>Nations of the World; there was a Partition-wall erected between them, and the ſpurious part of the World. And at the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, and the Tenders and Exhibitions of the Grace of Life, and Salvation, they were <hi>[Primi,]</hi> they had the firſt Effort of Mercy ſent and directed unto them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Such have their dwelling, and reſidence, where the gracious and peculiar Preſence of the Lord is to be enjoy'd; ſuch have an Habitation where God hath fixt his Throne of Grace, and where are his delightful Walks, the gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord is with his Church and People; thoſe that are his Covenant-Ones, they have the Signs, and the Symbols of his reſidence in the midſt of them. His general Preſence by a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Extenſion diffuſeth and diſpoſeth it ſelf eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where; but This is the alone Happineſs of his ſelect People to enjoy, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.7. <hi>For what nation is there ſo great, who hath God ſo nigh unto them?</hi> Great, becauſe nigh. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.1, 2. <hi>In Judah is God known: his name is great in Iſrael. In Salem alſo is his tabernacle, and his dwelling-place in Zion.</hi> Viz. His peculiar place of reſidence, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.3. <hi>And I heard a great voice out of heaven, ſaying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf ſhall be with them, and be their God.</hi> Where the Tabernacle of God is, himſelf is, and there he will dwell. How happy are they that dwell where God in a diſtinct manner doth dwell! And this is the Happineſs of all thoſe that dwell within the Bounds of the Covenant.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Thoſe that be in covenant, and are Members of the Church, are always comprehended in, and have the benefit of having a ſhare in the Prayers that are continually aſcending up unto God for all <hi>Iſrael.</hi> As it is the Duty of every ſincere and true Believer to make Supplications for himſelf,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44339:37"/>and to offer up this Sacrifice to God with the publick Aſſembly; ſo to be ſure to be very mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of <hi>Zion,</hi> and to be very importunate with the Lord for all the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Pſal. 122.6, 7. <hi>Pray for the peace of Jeruſalem. Peace be within thy walls, and proſperity within thy palaces.</hi> There is a continual Cloud of Prayers going up to Heaven for thoſe that are the Lords Incloſure, for all that are the Dwellers therein; every one, that is internally in covenant, will be ſure to pray for all that are any way in Federal Relation to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137.5, 6. <hi>If I forget thee, O Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.</hi> There is a continual Stock of Prayer treaſuring up for the Church of God, in which the Infant Seed of Believers have no ſmall Share. What an unſpeakable Benefit is this? To have an Intereſt in the many Thouſands, that dwell at the Throne of Grace, always putting God in mind of, and pleading with him the Covenant, Day and Night, for all thoſe that are within the compaſs of it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Election of Grace, doth eminently run among, and through the Lords Covenant-Ones; God hath his Election eminently amongſt them; the Golden Veins of Election are chiefly laid and diſpoſed in the Viſible Church; there be ſome to gather in, and ſome to build up, when the Lord hath gather'd up and called in his Elect in any Place, or among any People, he will caſt away the reſt: When all the Mine of Election is ſpent, then God departs, and tranſplants his Goſpel, and pitcheth his Tabernacle elſewhere, he knows where the ſecret Veins (of thoſe that are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally choſe by him) are to be found: He forſook the Places where the Seven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> had their reſidence, when he had brought forth all his Elect: The <hi>Jews</hi> were not to be rejected, till all

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44339:38"/>God.</hi> They were brought forth in a Foederal Bond, therefore the whole Maſs and Body of them obtain'd this Appellation: The moſt Holy, and the moſt High God admitted them unto this tall Pinacle of Honour, of being his Children.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Hence it is that all <hi>Iſrael</hi> God doth call his <hi>Son,</hi> intimating how diſtinguiſhingly the Lord doth aſſume and appropriate him to himſelf in this near Relation, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.22. <hi>And thou ſhalt ſay unto Pharaoh, Thus ſaith the Lord, Iſrael is my ſon, even my firſt-born.</hi> This was to be uſed as a powerful Motive to prevail upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to ſet <hi>Iſrael</hi> free from his cruel Bondage, he was the Lords. <hi>Ver.</hi> 23. <hi>And I ſay unto thee, Let my ſon go, that he may ſerve me:</hi> Wilt thou be ſo bold, as to detain in bondage him, that I the Great and Terrible God do own, and declare to be my <hi>Son?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Hence <hi>Ephraim</hi> is called Gods <hi>dear Son.</hi> Covenant-relation is very near, and ſo very <hi>dear</hi> unto God: All thoſe that are in covenant with him, are very near, and very <hi>dear</hi> unto him. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20. <hi>Is Ephraim my dear ſon? is he a pleaſant child? for ſince I ſpake againſt him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill: therefore my bowels are troubled for him.</hi> Here is not only Relation, but Bowels of Affections: <hi>Ephraim</hi> is not only the Lords <hi>dear Bon,</hi> but dearly and deeply beloved of God.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) They be from hence called the Children of the Promiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Children of the Covenant. Thoſe that have ſuch an Intereſt and Title to the Promiſe, as to be called the Children of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, being born within the Pale of the Covenant, they are the Heirs of the Promiſe deſcending of ſuch Parents, that do convey the precious Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto them.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) They be alſo called the Children of the Kingdom, born within the Covenant, and ſo brought forth in the Kingdom of God, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt in the World, where he as the

            <p n="8">(8.) Thoſe that be in Covenant are honoured with high and glorious Titles; and if we conſider what is the nature and dignity of them, we may ſee that they are not purely Titular, but are ſuch that do import ſome rare and renowned Priviledge; I ſhall name ſome of theſe Titles that be aſcribed unto them. (1.) Holy, thoſe that be in Covenant (although but externally ſo) are called holy, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.2. <hi>For thou art a holy people to the Lord thy God,</hi> a people ſeparated to God from the reſt of the World, the Covenant is holy, and thoſe that are incloſed within it are a holy People, they are the Lords holy, ſeparated ones. This we have tranſlated into the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the new Adminiſtration of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. <hi>For the unbelieving Husband is ſanctified by the Wife, and the unbelieving Wife is ſanctified by the Husband: elſe were your Children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, but now are they holy.</hi> Strange violence is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44339:39"/>offered to this Text, to deſtroy that federal holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that ſhines forth in it. The <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> (one would think) are put greatly to their ſhifts, in ſhifting off the force of this Text from them; when all that they will allow Believers from this Text is, that if one Parent be but a Believer, then they will free their Children from the foul charge, and ſcandalous imputation of being Baſtards: Thus they comment upon the words <hi>elſe were your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> Baſtards, but now they be Legitimate, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully begotten; what muſt be the conſequence of this, but that the Children of thoſe Parents neither of which is a Believer muſt, tho' they be never ſo lawfully Married, and live never ſo chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together, be Baſtards; what a multitude of the off-ſpring of this our Nation, muſt after this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation be illegitimate, and a ſpurious baſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Brood: This hath been ſo often confuted, that I will ſay no more to it, the very naming of it may be a ſufficient confutation of it. (2.) A peculiar people, a people ſet a part from others; the Covenant is for an encloſure, and ſo for a ſeparation of ſome from the reſt of the World, to be diſtinct, and peculiar from others, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.2. <hi>For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God, and the Lord hath choſen thee to be a peculiar people unto himſelf above all the nations that are upon the earth.</hi> The Lord hath a viſible people that are to him a peculiar people, they are his Church, thoſe that are in a peculiar Covenant-appropriation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him. We have this Title and that before of <hi>Holy</hi> aſcribed to thoſe that are under the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Covenant in new Teſtament times. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>But ye are a choſen generation, a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Prieſthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar people.</hi> (3) They be called Gods Houſhold or Family: the worſhip of God, and the bleſſing of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant firſt took place in Families, and thoſe were the Families of the Lord; ſince the more open,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44339:40"/>publick and diffuſive diſpencing of the Covenant, thoſe that are the Lords Covenant ones, retain ſtill the Title of a Family and Houſhold, and ſo this is brought down unto the time of the Goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. <hi>As we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men, eſpecially unto them who are of the houſhold of faith,</hi> Viz. Gods Covenant-houſhold, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Now therefore we are no more ſtrangers and foreiners, but fellow Citizens, and of the houſhold of God;</hi> thoſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> that were not in Covenant, and ſo not of the Houſhold of God. Now ſaith the Apoſtle, you are made partakers of the Covenant, which was the peculiar Bleſſing of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ye are become now of the Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of Faith, and of God, or of the Houſhold of Faith, and ſo of God; you are grafted into the Olive, and this is ſome of the ſweet and precious fat and juice of it. (4.) Such be called Gods Vineyard, or the garden of the Lords, ſurely it is a Singular Priviledge to be planted in the Lords Vineyard, and not to have a ſtanding without in the Wilderneſs of the World, which the Lord hath little regard for, or care of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.1, 7. <hi>Now I will ſing to my well beloved, a ſong of my beloved touching his Vineyard: My well beloved hath a Vineyard in a very fruitful hill; For the Vineyard of the Lord of Hoſts is the houſe of Iſrael, and the men of Judah his pleaſant plant.</hi> The Church of God in Covenant with Him is by the Lord Jeſus, the Husband and Bridegroom of it delightfully called a garden, it being the ſweeteſt, the moſt pleaſant and fertileſt ſpot in all the World, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.12, 16. <hi>A garden encloſed is my Siſter, my Spouſe; Awake, Oh north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, and come thou ſouth, and blow upon my garden, that the ſpices thereof may flow out.</hi> Cant. 5.1. <hi>I am come into my garden, my Siſter, my Spouſe,</hi> Cant. 6.2. <hi>My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of ſpices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather Lilies.</hi> Thus was the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> that was the

               </gap>ore particular Churches that make up the Church Catholick, are called golden Candleſticks, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.20. <hi>The myſtery of the ſeven Stars which thou ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in my right hand, and the ſeven golden Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, are the ſeven Churches:</hi> The Lord Jeſus walks in the midſt of them, they are the place of his feet, and his delightful walks, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.1. <hi>He walketh in the midſt of the ſeven golden Candleſticks,</hi> to ſhew his delight that he hath in them, the peculiar watch of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence about them, and his plentiful and his inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible ſupplying of them. Oh how good is it to dwell where Chriſt hath his continual reſidence, and his perpetual walks: 'tis a comfortable thing to have the Lord of infinite grace, to walk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to, and fro, by ones door; how ſoon may he open the door and come in, and bring his Bleſſed retinue of peace, mercy, grace, and love along with him. (6.) The Church of Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in this Covenant, is called Heaven, this is Heaven upon Earth, where the Throne of the bleſſed God is fixt; when the Lord takes Believers and their Children into Covenant with himſelf, he takes them into Heaven; thoſe that be out of Covenant do inhabit ſuch darkneſs, as to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thoſe that are even in Hell. I, but the Church of God that hath the light of the Word, and grace of God, ſhining upon it, is Gods heaven below, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.1. <hi>And there appeared a great wonder in heaven, a woman cloathed with the Sun.</hi> This wonder was ſeen in the Church of God below, I, but here called Heaven for her trampling upon the World, having the righteouſneſs of Chriſt begirt about her, and living in the Starry Region of Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical and Divine light.</p>
            <p>Thus I have in ſome Particulars endeavoured, to diſcover ſomething of the Priviledges of thoſe, that be in Covenant with the Lord from this head.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:44339:41"/>
            <p>I come to another Priviledge which is this, that many of them that are thus in Covenant ſhall be ſaved, a multitude of them are Elected, for here chiefly lyes the ſecret Mine of Election, where many ſhall be called, and Effectually brought home to God; the great Bulk and Maſs of the Elect are taken, and dug out of the Loins of Believers, that are brought under Covenant, many of thoſe that be in Covenant ſhall be ſure be to ſaved; therefore ſurely 'tis a great priviledge to have a ſtanding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe that ſhall be ſaved; how is it the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe that do enjoy this mercy to bleſs the Lord for it, and to improve it for their own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens advantage: 'Tis good to have a footing and dwelling in that Body, out of which the Lord doth call many to ſaving grace and glory, to be in the beſt capacity and the moſt hopeful diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to Externals for life and Salvation. The Soveraign Grace of God calls whom he pleaſeth; but moſt frequently the lot of Salvation, falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Children of Covenant Ones, they are the moſt hopeful to partake of that great bleſſing of the Covenant of effectual calling, and of having the Law of God to be ingraven upon their hearts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.13. <hi>And all thy Children ſhall be taught of the Lord.</hi> Thoſe that are not in Covenant with the Lord, as they do not regard, ſo neither are they under ſuch a hopeful expectation of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of ſuch a promiſe, as thoſe are, that are themſelves the Children of the Promiſe, who have good right to approach unto the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Throne, and plead ſuch a promiſe with him that ſits there with the Rain-bow of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant about his head.</p>
            <p n="10">10. This is the great ground, that is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred unto pious Parents, greatly concerned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the external good of the Souls of their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Ones, to build their hopes upon; godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, would caſt out the Anchor of hope upon a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44339:41"/>firm ground, ſuch that may hold; and this is the great, if not the only one, thoſe the Lord is pleaſed to bereave them of, and demand out of their tender boſoms, this may quiet their hearts about their death, and their eternal State. So that upon this account, a Parent may ſay more then what one ſaid of a dead Child, <hi>Ego in illo pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ero nihil habeo praeter dilectum,</hi> he may compoſe, and ſedate his Spirit with <hi>David,</hi> who while his Child was ſick, did faſt, and weep, refuſing to eat; I, but when the pleaſure of the Lord was ſignified by his death, he could ariſe, waſh and eat, and go to the houſe of the Lord, and calmly pour out his ſincere devotions unto the moſt high, ſaying unto them that were ſtruck into ſtupendous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of his great change, I ſhall go to him, but he ſhall not return to me. Surely <hi>David</hi> had a further proſpect than the grave that prevailed upon him to this Sedate compoſure, and Serenity of mind, he did intimate that his heart was at reſt as to his felicity above; that his Soul (that he was moſt concerned about) had made its eſcape from the ſick and painful Body, into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom: the great Covenant Father, he having this heart-ſupporting promiſe, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed:</hi> This is Goſpel and a man intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this promiſe may, nay is bound to lay hold upon it, and to caſt himſelf upon the promiſe, as well for his little Ones, as for himſelf. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath the Lord, as an Inſtance of his unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able grace, given ſuch a promiſe, if not in our great and cloſe afflictions to be choice, and ſuitable food, for our faith? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> but this can ſupport Parents when they ſee their tender Infants in the bitter bonds of death, reclining their heads upon their diſſolving Pillows, and having their Bowels to be ſounding and yearning within them. Now this, I would humbly demand, what they can build their hopes upon, to make them readily
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44339:42"/>to comply with Divine Pleaſure? When the Souls of their Little Ones ſit upon their Lips, to take their flight into an Eternal Ocean, that exclude<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> them out of that Covenant, they be confident they themſelves be in, and upon which they bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom and center all their truſt and confidence as to their own Salvation; for the ordinary way of Salvation is by and through the Covenant.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Thoſe that be in covenant thus have many great and temporal Bleſſings beſtow'd upon them, which others fall ſhort of; they ſhare in the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Providential Care, and Watch of God; there is the general Providential Care of God, which as he is an Omnipreſent Majeſty, filling all Places, Perſons, and Things, with his Eſſential Preſence, out of which there can be no departing, or abſconding, he doth extend unto all, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.7, 8, 9, 10. But moreover there is the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Tranſmiſſion of the Providential Care, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and Tuition of God, and this is that which every Moment doth environ and encircle the Church and Covenant-Ones round about, and all that are intereſted in the ſame ſtand poſſeſt with the free fruition of, they are the proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the peculiar and ſpecial Providential Watch of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121.4. <hi>Behold, he that keepeth Iſrael, ſhall neither ſlumber nor ſleep.</hi> This denotes the careful and the diligent keeping of the Church, the Lord is ever in the exerciſe of, as one ſaith, <hi>Curam, ſolicitudinem &amp; diligentiam connot at, nec dormit nec dormitat,</hi> He neither ſleeps nor ſlumbers.

               <hi>And he fenced it,</hi>— After he planted it, he ſet the Fence of his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Providence round about it, to preſerve it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.3. <hi>I the Lord do keep it, I will water it every moment; leſt any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.</hi> Thus we ſee what a peculiar Vigilancy the Divine Eye doth exhibit unto the Covenant-People:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44339:42"/>This is no ſmall Priviledge, to have a Place with thoſe that are thus beautify'd. I might have added, that ſuch have many outward Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of Peace, Plenty, and Proſperity, and that People, Places, and Nations, do enjoy many rare Mercies for their ſake; the Old World ſped the better for <hi>Noah</hi>'s ſake, <hi>Sodom</hi> for <hi>Lot's, Pharaoh</hi> for <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s, as <hi>Obed-edom</hi> for the Arks ſake, and <hi>Laban</hi> was greatly bleſſed for the ſake of <hi>Jacob.</hi> A Nation ſpeeds the better for the Goſpels ſake; moſt fare the better for the Elect, the greateſt Body of which deſcend from Covenant-Ones: Temporal Bleſſings are the Appendices of that Covenant made with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. where the <hi>Land of Promiſe</hi> was inſerted, though a far greater in that was intended, as hath been ſhewn. More Priviledges might have been convened unto theſe; but let what hath been ſaid ſuffice, and I think what hath been inſiſted upon may ſatisfie as to this <hi>Queſtion.</hi> We have ſeen that thoſe that are in covenant have <hi>advantage,</hi> and that <hi>much every way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before we diſmiſs this, let us a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly apply the Matter ſuitable to the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that I have laid down concerning the way of being in covenant, as to thoſe that be Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and thoſe that be Internally in it.</p>
            <p>Obſerve heedfully here, that the ſame Promiſes that are to the Parents, are to the Children, <hi>I will be their God, and the God of thy Seed.</hi> Thoſe that the Lord is pleaſed to take into covenant with himſelf, ſome are Elect, and ſome not E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; ſo amongſt the Children, ſome are Elect, and ſome not Elect; and here I chiefly mean thoſe that arrive unto the Years of the Adult.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe that be the Elect of the Natural Seed, they do partake both of the external, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part of the Covenant; for they do partake of the Promiſe in the extent of it, ſuch peculiar
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44339:43"/>ſalvificable Bleſſings, as Juſtification, Adoption, Sanctification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Eternal Glorification; in a Word, they do partake of Temporal, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and External Priviledges.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Non-elect they do partake of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal part of the Promiſes, and of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Priviledges (as have been mentioned) which be exceeding great, though not ſaving; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be relied and reſted upon. I ſhall here lay down Two <hi>Poſitions,</hi> that ſhall conclude this preſent Matter in hand.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That as God by the Election of Grace doth make the diſtinction among the Natural Seed of Covenanters with God, accordingly is their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens participation of the Promiſe. The Elect have the Promiſe in the extent, the other in the external part only, which in it ſelf is a Priviledge and a great Advantage. There might have been given great Inſtances of this in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, and others, but I forbear, and ſhall not need to ſtand upon it. There is the Elect <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was eſtabliſht with him in all its Spiritual and External parts; and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> the Son of a Bond-woman in covenant, and muſt be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed too, and participate of the Seal, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a great Nation, and have a Standing till his time come to be caſt out.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That there is great ground, and very good foundation, for a Parent in covenant with God, to pray, and to hope for the accompliſhment of the Covenant in the extent of it. Pious Parents in covenant with God, ſhould labour to lay hold upon the gracious Promiſes thereof, and put them daily in ſuit at the Throne of Grace, pleading of them for their poor Children with God; Ay, and this ſhould be done with a great deal of hope, and that partly, becauſe the Purpoſe of God is ſecret, and not to be the Rule of our Covenant-Duties, and the Promiſe is open in the full and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44339:43"/>ample Extent of it; and alſo becauſe Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſe is ſo full, copious, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, as to be the God of the Seed of thoſe Parents he hath highly gratified, and graced, in taking them into covenant with himſelf; which Faith ought in the largeſt ſence to take hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſwallow down, and to be warmly, and comfortably exerciſed about the inward, ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and eternal Bleſſings of the Covenant for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. But ſomewhat more of this, if the Lord pleaſe, in the Uſe of this Doctrine. Thus much for the firſt <hi>General Thing,</hi> Viz. <hi>The opening of this Point:</hi> Now we come unto the</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>General Head</hi> propoſed in my Method, which is to offer ſome <hi>Demonſtrations,</hi> to Evince the Truth of my <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and ſo we ſhall inſiſt upon the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of this <hi>Great Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. This hath ever been Gods way in covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his People; this way God hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ever ſince the Fall, yea, this was the way that he took in the firſt Covenant that ever was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded between him and Man, <hi>viz.</hi> The Covenant of Works that he made with <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, in his perfect State; <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Poſterity were ſtrictly included in that Covenant; ſo that as it fared with him, it was to be with all, that were to deſcend from his Loyns, or all his Seed, he falling, all fell in him, and with him. Upon his Fall, the bleſſed Covenant of Grace (that was eternally provided through Chriſt the great Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the Grace of God) took place and was publiſhed with Gods own Lips, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed: it ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</hi> Here we have the Seed immediately comprehended; this I take to be the very ſame Covenant for ſubſtance, that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44339:44"/>was made, and more fully explicated, confirmed, and eſtabliſhed with <hi>Abraham;</hi> where was the firſt emanation and ſpringing forth of the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible Fountain of Grace, through a Covenant for apoſtate and trembling <hi>Adam;</hi> who was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of no other Covenant in that his miſerable State: It was only naked, and pure Grace that could ſupport him from ſinking into eternal deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and deſtruction. Ever ſince the Fall of Man, God hath been pleaſed to gather a Church and People to himſelf by covenant, and he ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more hath taken in the Children with the Parents; when ever he hath made a Covenant with a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, with a People, and with a Nation, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver excluded, and ſhut out the Children, and Seed, accounting the Children to be of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, People, or Kingdom: This might be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proved, were it needful. We have fully ſeen it in the Lords covenanting with <hi>Abraham,</hi> taking in all his Natural Seed with him; a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and obvious Inſtance hereof we have in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.9, 10, 11, 12. One would think, that this ſhould for ever ſilence the <hi>Oppoſers</hi> of this Truth. Here we have the Adult, and all their Little Ones, ſtanding before the Lord, to enter into covenant with him; the Little Ones were confederate with their Parents, and entered into covenant in, and with them; thus when the Covenant was carried over to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were ſtill involved, as in our Text, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. <hi>For the promiſe is to you, and your children:</hi> And ſo it ſhall be unto all <hi>that are afar off,</hi> when they ſhall be called, and brought home unto God, they ſhall come with their Children with them, and enter into covenant with the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17, 19. If here Children of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> be not taken into the Covenant with the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the place of thoſe that were broken off, then there would be no Analogy, or Proportion, between
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44339:44"/>the rejection of one, and the acceptation of the other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Demonſt.</hi> This hath been Gods way in his conveying all ſaving Good unto the Elect; this is Gods ordinary way of communicating unto the Salvation of the Infants of Believers, they being actually in the Viſible Church, and in covenant with God, out of which ordinarily no Salvation can be expected, and hoped for. All the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that be made to Infants of any Spiritual Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, conducting to their Eternal Happineſs, are lodged in the Covenant; and the Promiſes are the Inſtruments of the Spirit of God, in its great Covenant-work of diſtilling, and infuſing Grace into the Hearts of the Elect dying Infants. Even before the World began, God ordained and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted all Good to be conveyed to us in a way, and by vertue of a Covenant; therefore 'tis cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>everlaſting covenant,</hi> and the <hi>everlasting goſpel,</hi> Heb. 13.20. <hi>Now the God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus, the great ſhepherd of the ſheep, through the blood of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting covenant.</hi> Rev. 14.6. <hi>And I ſaw another an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel flie in the midſt of heaven, having the everlaſting goſpel to preach unto them that dwell upon the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.</hi> This <hi>everlaſting goſpel</hi> I think may here be (though not excluſively, yet eminently) meant the Everlaſting Covenant of Grace, through which in the preaching of it, is tranſmitted all ſaving Good to all the Elect, in all the Nations, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Kindreds, and Languages in the World. Nay, Chriſt himſelf, that unſpeakable Gift, is all the Elects, both Infants, and Adult, in a way of a Covenant, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6. <hi>I the Lord have called thee in righteouſneſs, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, and for a light of the Gentiles.</hi> His Blood is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44339:45"/>the Blood of the <hi>everlaſting covenant,</hi> and there can be no Intereſt in it, nor in himſelf, but by way of Covenant; as there can be no Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no Reconciliation, no Juſtification, no San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, nor Salvation, but by and through his Blood; and that Blood is the Blood of the <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting covenant,</hi> Zech. 9.11. <hi>As for thee alſo, by the blood of thy covenant, I have ſent forth thy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners out of the pit, where there is no water.</hi> Some do underſtand this of a temporal deliverance out of ſome great and grievous Affliction, which the Lord did deliver his People; if ſo, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it muſt be by the <hi>blood of the covenant;</hi> by and through which the Elect are delivered out of all their <hi>Pits,</hi> and Miſeries, into which their Sins have caſt them. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is the Mediatour of the New Covenant, and if Infants be not in this Covenant, they can have no Intereſt in him, as Mediatour; for he is no Mediatour, but of ſuch a Covenant: His great Buſineſs is to confirm a Covenant, to all ſuch, to whom he is a Mediatour. Therefore to deny Infants being in covenant, is to ſhut them out of all hopes of partaking of one Drop of the Precious Blood of Chriſt, which is Covenant-Blood. And thus here is a dreadful Rock in the midſt of that Ocean of Miſery, that Sin hath brought them in, which poor Infants dying in their Infancy muſt una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably ſplit upon for ever; moreover here we may ſee them all to have ſuffered Shipwrack, without the leaſt part of a Wreck left them to ſwim to ſhore on. If it be ſo, that the Infints of Believers are excluded from Right in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the Promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, and Remiſſion of Sin, unleſs they do perſonally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs their Faith and Repentance, as our <hi>Challenger</hi> would have it, then they are out of all the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of Salvation, and deſperately expoſed to be loſt for ever.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:44339:45"/>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Demonſt.</hi> This hath been the way, that a holy and juſt God hath obſerved in ejecting, and caſting out of the Covenant. When Parents by their ſin have been diſinherited, and caſt out; their Children alſo have been turned out with them, we read of the breaking and taking in, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17, 19. The one muſt expound the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and one muſt be commenſurate and reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the other: otherwiſe the parallel, of the Holy Ghoſt, and the harmony of the matter will be broke. They which were broken off, were called natural branches; they and their natural Seed did grow upon this root, and both were broken off, not only the Parents, but the Children; God wrote upon them and their Children a <hi>Loammi.</hi> So when the Lord (thro' rich grace) did fill up their vacancy, and inſerted the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in their Room, in graffing them into the ſame Stock, making of them to partake of the root, and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Olive tree; it was they, the adult Parents that did believe, and all their Sprigs, their Children, that ſprang from them, that were graffed in. Here we muſt obſerve a meet Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the rejection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> look how the One was by unbelief broken off, ſo the others were taken in by Faith: but the one both Parents and Children were broken off thro' the ſtubborn rejection of the Covenant, not ſubmitting to the new Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it, when it was offered by the Apoſtles after the aſcenſion of the Meſſiah, which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the Parents only; therefore the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are inſerted with their Children, notwithſtanding the Parents only expreſs a Beleiving embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Covenant, and the Promiſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Demonſt.</hi> Children are Members of the viſible Church, where their Parents be in Covenant with
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44339:46"/>God, they be initiated by Baptiſm, and admitted into viſible Memberſhip; the breaking off was the caſting out of a viſible Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.14. <hi>But Jeſus ſaid, Suffer little Children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Our great Champion, will not have theſe to be little, in reſpect of the ſmalneſs of their growth, or littleneſs of their age, tho' it be never ſo ridiculous, and abſurd to deny it; what will not raſh men obtrude upon, to uphold their crude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted notions. Obſerve a little here theſe be not only called Children, but little Children, <hi>Luke</hi> calls them Infants, <hi>Chap.</hi> 18.15. <hi>And they brought unto him alſo Infants that he would touch them, viz.</hi> that he would bleſs them; they were ſuch that were brought, or born to Chriſt, they could not come themſelves: <hi>then were there brought unto him little Children,</hi> nay, they were ſo ſmall, and little that the Diſciples that attended upon their Lord, thought that they could only be a trouble to him, therefore they rebuked them that brought them; yea, and further 'tis ſaid that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus took them up into his arms, when he laid his hands upon them, and bleſſed them; he took them out of their Parents arms, or the arms of them that brought them, when he bleſſed them, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.16. Yea one thing more fully to prove that Children are to be taken literally, and not allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically, and that from the <hi>Greek</hi> word, that the Evangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi> makes uſe of, where 'tis ſaid, that they brought unto him <gap reason="foreign">

I do prefer the judgment of Learned and Critical <hi>Beza,</hi> before a thouſand ſuch Doctors as ours is: I will give you his ſenſe of the words in <hi>Luke ch.</hi> 18.5. and how he opens the words. There he tells us what theſe Infants are, theſe are his words, <hi>Teneri nimirum et adhuc ab uberibus pendentes pueruli,</hi> very little Children that hang up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Breſt, ſucking Babes, which are carried in the arms. <hi>Beza</hi> adds ſomething more and ſaith thus, <hi>Eſt enim adverſus hoſtes Paedo-baptiſmi ſervanda pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pria ſignificatio verbi</hi>

               </gap>, the proper ſignification of the words Infants, and that they were carried to Chriſt, and alſo that he took them into his arms, when he bleſſed them, muſt be kept. But I may have an opportunity to meet with my Adverſary in a more ſuitable place: Thus we ſee what little things the Seed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers be, that are Members of the Church viſible; for by Kingdom of Heaven is (by all judicious Divines) taken to be the viſible Church: Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be declared by Chriſt himſelf to be ſuch Members with their Parents, they muſt alſo with them be in Covenant with God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Demonſt.</hi> The Parents by Covenant do ingage themſelves, and their Children unto God. When
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44339:47"/>Parents do enter into Covenant with the Lord, they do by the Bonds of the ſame, oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and theirs unto the Lord, and to be the Lords for ever. Every Covenant-Parent does ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige himſelf, and his Seed to God, to walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Covenant of Grace, to which the Initiating Seal of the Covenant is annext; and God doth promiſe to be his God, and the God of his Seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. Parents when they do dedicate their Children to God, by the Seal of the Covenant, then they do ingage to the utmoſt of their power, that they ſhall obſerve the Duties of the ſame: So Children when they are Adult, ought by Faith to lay a firm hold upon the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and anſwer the Obligation of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. In a Federal Conſideration, when Parents do ingage for their Children; this (as it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been) is accounted among the Judicious the Act of the Children, in, and by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and they are obliged ſtrictly to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the ſame. That Parents have thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for their Children in covenant with God, might be eaſily proved, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.17, 18. In which place Parents and their children are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, as is more fully and ſpecifically ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in <hi>Chap.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. There we have the little ones expreſſed, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved with their Parents in the former place. Some that are Adverſaries herein, pretend to wonder how this can be; but what is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among Men? In a Mans Covenant, do not Men put their Childrens Names in their <hi>Writings Obligatory?</hi> And their Little Ones, and thoſe unborn, ſhall <hi>ſtand firmly obliged</hi> thereby; and the Law doth take it as <hi>firm,</hi> as if the Child had actually bound himſelf. A little to Illuſtrate and Invigorate this; We are to conſider that the Children when grown up, and prove ſinful, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to the Covenant, yea, and thoſe that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44339:47"/>never did receive the Token of the Covenant by Circumciſion, ſtand accuſed of the <hi>high Charge</hi> of breaking the Covenant, which is an Evident Proof of their being (when but Infants) in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; otherwiſe this <hi>Charge</hi> could not be ſo clearly exhibited againſt them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.25. <hi>The men ſhall ſay, Becauſe they have forſaken the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Lord God of their fathers;</hi> Viz. the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which the Lord God made with their Fathers. This you have but a few <hi>Verſes</hi> before, to demonſtrate that it was that Covenant the Lord made with the Parents and their Little Ones that ſtood before him, to covenant with him, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.10, 14. You may ſee what Covenant this was, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.23. <hi>And the Lord was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious unto them, and had compaſſion on them, and had reſpect unto them, becauſe of his covenant with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, and Jacob, and would not deſtroy them, neither caſt he them from his preſence:</hi> Yet they had broken this Covenant, and for the Covenant's ſake, they deſcending from the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and being the Seed of thoſe, with whom he had made this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, he would not enter upon them for the breach they made upon it, to extinguiſh or to deſtroy them, as yet. It was the Covenant that did bind up and reſtrain the Hands of Juſtice from caſting off the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Children of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and of the Covenant; therefore the Lord is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.5. — <hi>He will ever be mindful of his covenant.</hi> Gen. 17.14. <hi>And the uncircumciſed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child whoſe fleſh of his fore-skin is not circumciſed, that ſoul ſhall be cut off from his people: he hath broken my covenant.</hi> Surely if the Seed of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in covenant are accuſed for the breaking of the Covenant, they themſelves muſt be in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and obliged by their Parents to keep it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Demonſt.</hi> Such as God is pleaſed to account and accept as holy, are in covenant. Thoſe that have a Foederal Holineſs muſt be Foederates, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44339:48"/>ſuch that be in covenant with the Lord; but this is the great Bleſſing of thoſe that are the Children of believing Parents; there is a Holineſs attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, that is not to the Seed of <hi>Pagans,</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> and it is a Covenant-Holineſs; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt follow by undeniable conſequence, That <hi>they are in covenant with their Parents.</hi> What makes <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and his Seed, more holy than the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> or <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and their Seed, but God's taking one into covenant, and not the other? Thus <hi>Iſrael</hi> and his Seed are ſaid to be <hi>holy,</hi> Deut. 14.2. <hi>For thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God.</hi> If but one Parent be in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the Children be accepted as holy with the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. Becauſe of this, the Children are not unclean as the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> but holy like the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> I have ſpoke ſomething to this in the Explication of this <hi>Point,</hi> therefore ſhall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten over it; it would be to ſmall purpoſe to enter into the Miry Labyrinth, wherein ſome have lodg'd this <hi>precious Scripture:</hi> I ſhall only ſay this (with an Acute Perſon,) That commonly Reaſons of <hi>Poſitions</hi> are brought <hi>à notiori,</hi> to prove a thing doubtful by a thing known, yeilded, or confeſt; this I judge to be a granted and a well-known <hi>Truth,</hi> as one of the <hi>Jews</hi> Divine <hi>Axioms:</hi> But that none but Believers Children are Legitimate, and that none but Believers have a lawful uſe of their Children, which are the two uſual Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of the <hi>Adverſaries</hi> on that Text, which to me ſeems very jeiune, and ſpurious; thoſe will hardly paſs for unqueſtionable <hi>Truths</hi> among the wiſeſt of Men: And to make the Apoſtle argue thence to prove the lawful continuance of the Believer, in conjugal Society with the Unbeliever, would make the Apoſtle guilty of proving <hi>obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum per obſcurius,</hi> an obſcure thing by that which is more dark and obſcure: But to take Holineſs there, for that which is Foederal, that is a clear
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44339:48"/>
               <hi>Medium</hi> to prove that; and whoſoever ſhall ſtand up and oppoſe it, there is the Diſpenſation of the Covenant with <hi>Iſaac</hi> all along, and that continued in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches to prove it. <hi>Your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are holy,</hi> Viz. Heirs to the Covenant, a known Truth, then granted and allow'd by all, even like unto our Text, That <hi>the Covenant was to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and their Children.</hi> How can the Children of Believers be ſaid to be holy, if they be not in covenant with their Parents? From whence all the Seed of Believers do receive the denomination, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. <hi>For if the firſt-fruit be holy, the lump is alſo holy: and if the root be holy, ſo are the branches.</hi> The Root is <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and they may be ſaid to be the Firſt-fruits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were firſt conſecrated to God; and the Branches are denominated from the Root, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.6. <hi>And ye ſhall be unto me a kingdom of prieſts, and an holy nation.</hi> Here the whole Nation was called holy: How could it be called ſo? Not becauſe all the Individuals of the Nation were perſonally holy, partaking of a ſaving Work of Holineſs upon their Hearts: There were but a few ſuch: But becauſe as a Nation the Adult, and Children were in covenant with the Lord; for the Children were no ſmall part of the Nation. We have this very <hi>Phraſe</hi> conferred upon the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, in the Times of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>But ye are a choſen generation, a royal prieſthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people.</hi> Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Gentiles,</hi> with their Seed, were ingrafted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame Place from whence the <hi>Jews</hi> were broken off, and are become <hi>a holy nation</hi> unto God.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Demonſt.</hi> Thoſe unto whom the Promiſes of the Covenant are made, and do appertain; they are in Covenant with the Lord: Some time the Covenant is expreſt by the Promiſe as in our Text,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44339:49"/>and the Covenant of Promiſe, the gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the word are the branches of the Covenant of grace: Some do ſtile the Covenant a Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or bundle of Promiſes which God hath bound up, and conferred (through Chriſt) upon his People, unto which there are annext the duties of the Covenant, unto the performance: Of which there is proviſion made in the ſame Covenant of grace, and divine aſſiſtance: But the promiſes of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant are made to the Children of thoſe, that are themſelves in Covenant, as well as to the parents; it ſeems to be very cruel and irrational to turn thoſe out of the Covenant, unto whom are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the gracious promiſes of it, not only Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and external, but Spiritual and eternal bleſſings are promiſed unto the Children of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. Thoſe that are the oppoſers of this truth, muſt firſt Obliterate all the Promiſes that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the Covenant, as the inheritance of the Seed of the Parents that themſelves are in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the Lord. As to any common ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary rule appointed to us, belonging to our duties and hopes concerning our off-ſpring; we have nothing (as I know) to build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but Covenant promiſes: What an) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent one is our Text unto pious Parents, as to their Children; and in this it is founded, for the Promiſe is to you, and your Children. To illuſtrate and amplifie this, I ſhall in ſeveral particulars ſhew you ſome of the Ranks of Covenant-Promiſes, that are extended unto ſuch little Ones, that are the undoubted Proprietors of them.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That great and Capital promiſe, of the Lords being their God, this comprehends all the reſt, and is <hi>inſtar omnium.</hi> Is not this Promiſe, made to the Seed, of Believers, wrote in Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Letters in many places, in the word of God? This is Gods great record in the Covenant of grace; and the great foundation the Church of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44339:49"/>God is built upon, <hi>(viz.)</hi> this of Gods promiſing to be the God of his people, and of their Seed in every age, and generation of time, yea, to the end of the World, <hi>uſ<expan>

                  </expan> ad conſummationem omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> unto the compleating and fulfilling of all things. Thus the bleſſed conſtitution, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of the Covenant hath alwayes run; this is wrote with a <hi>Noverint univerſi.</hi> That which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one under the ſound of the Goſpel ſhould know and underſtand; yea, even thoſe that are but raw, and rudely inſtructed in the very Principles and Rudiments of Religion. This gracious promiſe, is the golden Frontis-piece of this Covenant. The heart of God was ſo full of grace and love, to the Seed of the faithful, that when he called <hi>Abraham</hi> to eſtabliſh his Covenant, the fountain of his grace, did immediately emit this ſacred, ſweet, and moſt refreſhing Stream, <hi>Viz. That I will be thy God and the God of thy Seed;</hi> and that in all Succeſſions and periods of time, unto the utmoſt bound and period of all, read the Scriptures follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Jer.</hi> 24.7. and 31.33. and 32.38. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.20. and 34.24, 31. <hi>Chap.</hi> 36.28. <hi>Chap.</hi> 37.27. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.27. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17, 18. Theſe rare promiſes muſt be expung'd out of the Book of God, before I can, (unleſs left by God to fall into error;) put this Article out of my Creed, that the Children of Believers naturally Springing from their Loins are in the Covenant with them. I have ſpoke much already to prove that the Covenant in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. made unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to the Covenant of Grace. Some may be making of ſome Query, about that; becauſe they ſee, what muſt be the Conſequence of granting of it. Wherefore I would deſire them to return back unto what hath been ſaid upon that Point: Only I will add one or two things here. (1.) In this form run the promiſes (which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all, that know any thing) of the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44339:50"/>Goſpel-Covenant, or Covenant of grace; let all the places of Scripture, immediately here before mentioned, be examined as to the Phraſe of them, <hi>I will be a God to you,</hi> or your God; <hi>and you my people,</hi> which includes Believers and their Seed: Now in as much as this in the 17. of <hi>Gen.</hi> runs in the ſame Phraſe of the Covenant of grace that we ſee in other places that are allowed to be ſuch, we may conclude, that ſuch is this alſo. Doctor <hi>Ames</hi> ſaith thus againſt <hi>Bellar. Omnia illa quae ſpectant ad novum foedus eadem phraſi ſummatim ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicantur.</hi> So that when we are challenged to prove the Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, and Circumciſion to be a Seal of the Covenant of grace; Note that in this Point we have to do with our old Adverſaries the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> tho' marching forth under the banner of a People of another Denomination; for their Doctrine as to the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the place mentioned, is thus, that it was a Covenant of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bleſſings, this is indeed the Doctrine of the worſt of them, thus ſaith <hi>Bellar. Legimus Deum promiſiſſe Abrahamo, quando illi injunxit Circumciſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, terrena tantùm ad literam,</hi> i. e. <hi>propagationem poſteritatis, &amp; terram paleſtinae.</hi> Again, <hi>Illis verbis, ero Deus tuus, ſignificat totum promiſſum peculiaris protectionis.</hi> Thus we may ſee, that our great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putant doth ſweetly lick up the Doctrine of this great Doctor of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> tho' to give him his due, I believe he is not overmuch verſed in him; to which Doctor <hi>Ames</hi> anſwers, <hi>Legimus benedictionem illam Abrahamo promiſſionem fuiſſe plane eandem cum illâ, quâ jam fideles ex gentibus juſtificabantur.</hi> Gal. 3. Now when the Holy Ghoſt teſtifies in Scripture every where, that the Goſpel-Covenant runs in that form; why ſhould we fall in with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and take their word for it, that that is no Goſpel Covenant? But let us hearken to Chriſt, the beſt Expoſitor and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyer
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44339:50"/>of Scripture, who is the Subſtance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Oracle of all divine truths, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.31, 32. <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>touching the Reſurrection of the dead, have ye not read, what was ſpoken unto you by God, ſaying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living;</hi> where our Saviour affirms, that the preſent glorification of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s, <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s and <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Spirits and the future Reſurrection of their bodies, to live with God, both Soul and body for ever, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in that Promiſe, and the very accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that promiſe, <hi>I am the God of Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. Hence this clearly appears to be a Covenant of grace, of Spiritual and eternal Bleſſings.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The promiſe of the Spirit is made to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of thoſe Parents, that be in Covenant; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt be alſo in Covenant. Such unto whom God promiſeth his own Spirit, their's is the promiſe and Covenant of grace; for that is a Covenant of promiſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>A new heart will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you,</hi> ver. 27. <hi>And I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ways.</hi> The promiſe of the Spirit is one of the moſt gracious promiſes that the Covenant of grace is inriched withall. Chriſt and the Spirit are the two Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical promiſes. When Chriſt was upon the earth, and haſtning towards his aſcenſion, this was the great promiſe that he made to be left behind him; and this is the promiſe that by the gracious gift of God doth appertain to the Children of thoſe that are in Covenant with the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3. <hi>For I will pour water upon him that is thirſty, and flouds upon the dry ground, I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my bleſſing upon thy off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring;</hi> Little Children that ſpring like little twigs from their parents, that be graffed into the Covenant: <hi>Chap.</hi> 59.21. <hi>As for me, this is my
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44339:51"/>Covenant with them, ſaith the Lord, My ſpirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put into thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, ſaith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.</hi> Here is a bleſſed Promiſe to the Parents, and the Children, of this rare Priviledge of the Spirit, with a perpetual Entail, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2.38, 39. <hi>Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jeſus, for the remiſſion of ſins, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the holy Ghoſt. For the promiſe is unto you, and to your children;</hi> Viz. The Promiſe of Remiſſion of Sin, and of the Holy Ghoſt. The Truth is, Dying Infants without this promiſe could never be ſaved.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The Promiſe of Regeneration belongs to ſuch Children. Such to whom the Lord promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Regeneration, and Renovation, muſt needs be in covenant, to them doth belong the Promiſe and Covenant of Grace, for that is a Bleſſing of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>A new heart alſo will I give unto you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you, and I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you an heart of fleſh.</hi> This doth expreſly ſet forth the Work of the Holy Spirit, in renewing, and ſanctifying, and regenerating the Hearts of the Elect; this is that which is promiſed to the Off-ſpring of thoſe in covenant with the Lord; therefore they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves muſt alſo be in covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. <hi>And the Lord thy God will circumciſe thy heart, and the heart of thy ſeed to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy ſoul.</hi> The Seal of Circumciſion, the Token of the Covenant, did eminently ſignifie, and Aſſure this to all the Elect Infants that were in covenant; therefore Regeneration and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication are oftentimes ſet forth by Circumciſion, and when the Lord calls for them, he doth it under the Name and Notion of Circumciſion:
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44339:51"/>This might have been evidenced by many place<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p n="4">(4.) The Promiſe of being taught of God is an Excellent Promiſe of the Covenant of Grace; thoſe that do partake of a Standing in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, this is one of the Evangelical Promiſes that they are entituled unto, thoſe ſhall have a greater Teacher than Man, <hi>viz.</hi> they ſhall be taught of God, and by his Spirit. This is the Promiſe that is made with ſuch Infants, that are in covenant with their Parents, though ſome do ſcornfully ſay, What can they learn? Or what are they capable to be taught? Let ſuch know, that they have reaſonable Souls; and God by his Spirit can eaſily teach them, and they be under the promiſe of being taught of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. <hi>And they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord: for they ſhall all know me, from the leaſt of them unto the greateſt.</hi> God can teach the leaſt Infant to know him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.13. <hi>And all thy children ſhall be taught of the Lord.</hi> Let us conſider can any but thoſe that be taught of God be admitted unto the Eternal Injoyment of God: He will take no ignorant Sinner into the company of the Glorifi'd. It is ſaid of <hi>Timothy,</hi> that from a Child he knew the holy Scriptures, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. Every one of you (I preſume) will readily grant, that his Knowledge was ſaving, and that he was effectually taught of God; and I muſt tell you, that he was very little when firſt he was
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44339:52"/>taught, and this will appear, if we conſider the <hi>Word</hi> in the Text, <hi>And that from a child thou haſt known the holy ſcriptures</hi>

It is an eaſie matter for God to fulfil the Excellent Promiſes of the Covenant, and to cauſe the Babe that falls out of the Womb, to fall into the Arms of Grace, and he that ſucks on the Breaſt to draw in the Heavenly Knowledge of Chriſt; otherwiſe how can many be taken from the Breaſt and the Womb to Heaven, as doubtleſs a Multitude of Coverant-Babes are?</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) The Promiſe of Juſtification, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sin, is an Excellent Promiſe of the Covenant of Grace: The Blood of Chriſt is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this Foederal Mercy, not only to waſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Filth, but alſo to remove the guilt of Sin. Pardon of Sin is one of the moſt deſirable Branches of this Covenant, there can be no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the pardon of one Sin without it; all the Promiſes of pardon are founded upon the Grace of God, and ſatisfaction made to Divine Juſtice by the Blood of the Son of God, whoſe Blood is the Blood of the <hi>Everlaſting Covenant.</hi> I ſhall not ſtand to mind you of the many Promiſes that we have of Remiſſion; the Word of God doth abound with them, and whereſoever you find any of them, you may conclude, that they do relate to the Covenant of Grace. Now the Covenant-Seed of thoſe that be Believing Parents, have a ſhare in thoſe Promiſes that hold out a Free and Full pardon of Sin, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. <hi>Repent, and be baptized every one,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for the remiſſion of ſins, For the promiſe is to you, and your Seed,</hi> Viz. That Promiſe and Covenant that hath made proviſion
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44339:52"/>for the Remiſſion of your Sin, and the Sin of your Children; for they had involved their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren into the guilt of their Sin, but in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant there is pardon for both, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.24, 25. <hi>Surely, ſhall one ſay, In the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength. In the Lord ſhall all the ſeed of Iſrael be juſtified, and glory.</hi> The rich Proviſions of the Covenant of Grace have laid up for the Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Remiſſion for the Seed of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">(6.) Such to whom God is pleaſed to promiſe Bleſſedneſs, theirs is the Promiſe, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace: But the Children of thoſe that are in covenant, are promiſed Bleſſedneſs. Such that be under ſuch a Promiſe as this is, have right to be lookt upon to be in the Covenant of Grace. In the Covenant of Works, there are the terrible Curſings of a Juſt and Righteouſly angry God: But in the Covenant of Grace, there you may hear the Soul-comforting Voice, that pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth all Bleſſings, yea Bleſſedneſs it ſelf; and this Bleſſed Voice is ſounded out to the Little Ones of thoſe Parents that are in covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.25, 26. <hi>I have been young and now am old: yet have I not ſeen the righteous forſaken, nor his ſeed begging bread. He is ever merciful, and lendeth: and his ſeed ſhall be bleſſed.</hi> What Bleſſedneſs is there which is not in, and from that Covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: thy bleſſing is upon thy people.</hi> Thus I have done with this <hi>Demonſtration</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> by which I have endeavoured to ſhew that the Seed of thoſe that are in covenant muſt be ſo, becauſe the precious Promiſes do belong unto them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Demonſt.</hi> To Evidence the Truth of this <hi>Point,</hi> thoſe from whom God demands Covenant-Duty, and doth challenge the ſame from them; to them the Promiſe, and the Covenant doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain: The ſame Covenant that ſaith, <hi>You ſhall
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44339:53"/>be my people,</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will be your God.</hi> Now the Covenant requires of the Children of Gods People, that they be Gods People too, therefore they be in covenant. Look as the Parents do covenant for their Children, in their Infancy, ſo 'tis their Duty (ſo ſoon as may be) to counſel, and to inſtruct them, as Covenant-children to know, to love, to fear, to ſerve and obey God. Theſe are Covenant-Obligations: Thoſe that the Lord is pleaſed to take into Foederal-relation with himſelf, to be his People; it is that they may be found in the conſtant and perſevering diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of Relative Duties: <hi>Thou ſhalt be my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> What only to partake of Priviledge? No; but alſo to perform Duty. <hi>Abraham</hi> was very ſenſible of this, and therefore did command and oblige all of his, what he could, to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in all neceſſary and incumbent Covenant Duties. See what obſervation the Lord did make of him, and what a Commendation he faſtens upon him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. <hi>For I know him, that he will command his children and his houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, to do juſtice and judgment.</hi> All Parents in covenant ought to ſee to this; they are ingag'd in covenant with, and for their Children, and are under an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable Obligation to ſee that their Children walk and act ſuitably to the Priviledges, and Duties of it. God expects a Revenue of Honour from covenant Children, therefore he doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their Parents to bring them up in the Fear and Admonition of the Lord, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.4. <hi>And ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</hi> Thus <hi>Timothy</hi> was educated and brought up from a little child. Children are to be dedicated unto God by the Seal of the Covenant, by which they be bound to fear God, to ſerve, to obey him, to keep his <hi>Word,</hi> and to walk in his <hi>Way;</hi> as
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44339:53"/>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> did inſtruct and command his to do. Believers Children muſt be under Gods diſcipline, bound to Gods Worſhip, kept in Gods Way; they be the Lords People. Muſt this be, and no Covenant-priviledge belong unto them, and be what <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> only be? This is the <hi>Covenant-Diſpenſation,</hi> firſt <hi>Priviledge,</hi> and then <hi>Duty;</hi> therefore Children that are in covenant with the Lord are called Diſciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. <hi>Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the diſciples,</hi> — They are in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar manner to be inſtructed, and taught as thoſe from whom God expects early Service.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Demonſt.</hi> The ſame Covenant is transferr'd unto the Times of the Goſpel, ſince the Actual Exhibition and Aſcenſion of the Meſſiah; the ſame for Eſſence, and Subſtance, though in the Adminiſtration of it, it may vary in ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; the believing; and the covenanted <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſtand in the very ſame Condition by Faith, and in the very ſame Kingdom-ſtate for the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of it, out of which the <hi>Jews,</hi> through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, were broken and caſt off; for they were graffed, <gap reason="foreign">

And it hath its firſt riſe from that ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and never-failing Promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. which will run through all the Ages of the World, whereſoever God hath his Elect, by the preaching of the Goſpel to call into, and to incloſe within the limits of the Covenant. It was the Saying of a great Man, that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon a new Covenant bottom, were ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally a Viſible Church; for by them, the World, as well as the Church, as to be built. Here when the Lord did reveal his Grace, and gracious Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, he took in the Seed alſo, in the very downing and firſt day-ſpring of the Goſpel, God
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44339:54"/>takes in the Seed of the Woman, ſo afterwards to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo all along until the Time of the calling of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Now in the Times of the Goſpel, thoſe that be called, be the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham,</hi> they, and their Seed, have a happy admittance into the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and are Heirs according to promiſe, and bleſſed with that ever-living Father. The <hi>New Teſtament</hi> doth abundantly teſtifie of this; in many Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we have the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> Phraſe and Way, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Many ſhall come from the eaſt and from the weſt, and ſhall ſit down with Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.</hi> By the Faith of the <hi>Centurion</hi> Chriſt takes an occaſion to touch by way of prediction of the <hi>calling</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the <hi>rejection</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the bringing of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> into the Covenant made with thoſe <hi>Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Patriarchs.</hi> I do not know how to forbear the inſerting of an excellent Obſervation that a Judicious Man makes upon this Text, thus, <hi>Quare non ſine admiratione hoc additum fuit dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticos regni Dei, &amp; haeredes fore, qui tunc extranei erant, neque id ſolum, ſed foedus ſalutis mox publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candum eſſe, ut totus orbis in unum Eccleſiae corpus coaleſceret, dum Gentiles qui ad fidem accedunt ejuſdem cum</hi> Abram, Iſaac, <hi>&amp;</hi> Jacob, <hi>ſalutis par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipes fore dicit.</hi> Luke 19.9. <hi>And Jeſus ſaid unto him, This day is ſalvation come to this houſe, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he alſo is the ſon of Abraham.</hi> Here our Lord Jeſus did preach the Covenant, and upon the Faith of this good Man, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant entred into his Houſe, himſelf, and whole Family were taken into covenant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.31, 32, 33. This was the happy State of this Man, ſo ſoon as he did believe, God took him into covenant and his whole Houſe, and all of them in the ſame Hour of the Night, did partake of the Seal of the Covenant, after this Example we practice, <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. This was the caſe of <hi>Lydia,</hi> upon her
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44339:54"/>believing, ſhe, and all her Houſe were Baptized, 'Tis ſtrange if that in all theſe houſes, there might not be one Child, there might be children in ſeveral of them; however children be a part, and a choice part of houſholds. So that here is a Rule for us to walk by, that when the Maſter or head of the houſe doth imbrace the Faith, that was never Baptized before, both he, and his, are to receive the token of the Covenant, as upon their believing, they do enter into it with God. This is the right way to be obſerved, that Parents entertaining the Goſpel, that were never under the bond of the Covenant, neither partakers of the Seal of it, muſt be baptized; and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that are Foederally received with them by God, muſt be alſo with them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis of faith, that it might be by grace, to the end the promiſe or the Covenant might be ſure to all the ſeed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that alſo which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, Viz.</hi> He is the Father of all that do believe, both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile, Eph.</hi> 2.13, 14. <hi>But now in Chriſt Jeſus, ye who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times were far off, are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt: For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Now by the blood of Chriſt the parting Wall that was between the <hi>Jew</hi> and the <hi>Gentile</hi> is taken away, and both of them that believe are incloſed in one Covenant. The <hi>Gentile</hi> that was afar off being out of Covenant, and the <hi>Jew</hi> that was nigh being in Covenant. Now in the New Covenant all our Spiritual and Eternal bleſſings come ſwimming to us upon the blood of Chriſt, which blood for ever runs thro' the Covenant. We have no other way of remiſſion of Sin, of renovation and Regeneration, or of Eternal life, then <hi>Abraham</hi> had in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>John</hi> 8.56. Neither doth the Lord require

            <p n="10">10. <hi>Demonſt.</hi> God doth challenge the Children of his people, that be in Covenant with him, to be his Children. There is a ſpecial Intereſt and propriety, that God layes claim to have in the Seed of his, they be more his children, then their's; they are brought forth for him, and by the Seal of the Covenant are, and ought to be devoted and dedicated to God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.20, 21. <hi>Moreover thou haſt taken thy Sons, and thy Daughters, whom thou haſt born unto me, and theſe haſt thou ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed unto them to be devoured: That thou haſt ſlain my children.</hi> This is brought in, as a great aggravation of their ſin, in their cruel and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Idolatry; becauſe their Children were thoſe that God had a propriety in, tho' they were their Parents children by generation; yet they were his by Adoption, and Federal aſſumption. To offer any Creature to an Idol, is a great ſin, but to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Children is far worſe, and to offer Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that is worſt of all.

            <p n="11">11. <hi>Demonſt.</hi> Shall be taken from many groſs, (I wiſh I might not ſay wicked) abſurdities, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the denying Infants intereſt in the Covenant of grace with their Parents. That Doctrine can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be of God, that is cloathed with, or attended upon with many abſurdities.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44339:55"/>Lord Proprietor hath given them in the Covenant, are not apprehenſive what abſurd things do attend them. The Livery of this Doctrine diſcovers it to be of no good Family; its retinue may render it very queſtionable, yea, very unſound. The truths of Chriſt admit of no abſurdities, of no groſs Inferences; you can infer nothing from any Doctrine of the Goſpel, but what is pure, and precious: Men to ſupport their Errors, may endeavour to extort, and wreſt the holy Scriptures, to ſpeak their filthy Language, and to give countenance to their odious <hi>Tenents.</hi> This is one of the Worſt abuſes and helliſh Rapes that can be offered to the word of God. Satan himſelf hath an exquiſite skill herein, and he hath taught many of his Diſciples a dextrous knack in this black Art. Did but the Adverſaries of this my Doctrine conſider into what abſurdities they chaſe their Game; and how the pretended beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful face of their opinion is ſcratcht and torn, it would make them a little more modeſt and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in their aſſertions and concluſions.

            <p n="1">1. This doth impoſe a great reſtraint upon the bleſſed Covenant, contracting the large and copious grace of God, that is involv'd in it. This clips the wings of the love, grace and mercy of God, that doth dilate and amplifie themſelves in a Covenant way. Men may boaſt and vaunt that they are the great admirers, and promoters of the riches of Divine grace, but ſo long as they do Eclipſe, and obſcure the glory, and the brightneſs of it in the Covenant; ſo long they are but empty Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders, like unto ſounding Braſs, and a tinkling Cymbal. The great way that the fountain of Grace hath alwayes taken to diffuſe and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44339:56"/>it ſelf, ever ſince the miſerable ſtate of Man ſtood in need of it, hath been thro' the Covenant of grace; out of which to exclude Infants, is the ready way to contract, abbreviate and to confine it in ſtraighter Channels then ever God intended it for. What a wonderful reſtraint is here fixt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the grace of God, when Parents muſt only be taken in, and all their Infants muſt be thruſt out; when Parents muſt be the Children of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and of the Promiſe, and their Seed muſt be the Children of the Pagans and Heathens, and in no better a capacity as to any Spiritual privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges then they; when much of the Luſtration and admired beauty of it is (by every unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced Eye) clearly to be ſeen from the gracious extent of it, to the Seed of thoſe that are taken into it. Thus with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all along, and thus in our Text, <hi>the Promiſe is to you, and your Seed.</hi> Nay, this is to make an eſſential violation upon, and alteration of the Covenant, without any colour of pretence, or ſhadow of reaſon in the leaſt: For we never read ſince the inſtitution of it, that ever Children were ſhut out.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This makes the caſe and condition of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren far worſe than they were before the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and aſcenſion of Chriſt; and it makes the Covenant-State of believing Parents to be worſe: for before they were not only themſelves in the happy compaſs of the Covenant, but they had their Children with them alſo, <hi>[to thee, and to thy ſeed.]</hi> Here ran the Glory, the Grace, and the Promiſes of the Covenant, to incourage the convinced <hi>Jews</hi> to believe, and repent. The Apoſtle in my Text doth aſſure them, that the Promiſe is not only to them, but to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren likewiſe. Methinks what a bloody Knife is here at the Throat of all the gracious Covenant-promiſes made to Infants, or poor Children. By this opinion they have ſmall ground
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44339:56"/>of rejoycing at the appearance of Chriſt in the fleſh, that did immediately abandon them out of the Covenant. We read <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.15. of Children crying in the Temple, <hi>and ſaying, Hoſanna to the ſon of David:</hi> But this Doctrine of ſhutting them out of the Covenant gives them but little ground of thoſe acclamations. But their ſounding out of the praiſes of the Redeemer, is a clear Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation that it was for their ſake, that he was come to impart unto, and to inrich them with all the redemption-bleſſings wrapt up in the Covenant. Doubtleſs their amazing <hi>Hoſannah</hi>'s they poured out to their Mediatour of that Covenant they did partake of, were by a Supernatural inſtinct and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.16. <hi>Have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes, and ſucklings thou haſt perfected praiſe?</hi> The Lord Jeſus never came into the World to contract, but to inlarge the Covenant; he was ſo far from turning Children out of the Covenant, as that he hath extended it unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and all the nations of the World, and their Seed, upon their believing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This ſhuts out, and deprives them of the ordinary way of Salvation; as to extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary wayes, we have no Rule to walk by, what a prejudice is here offered to Infants? And what a Soul-deſtructive <hi>Tenent</hi> is that, which deprives little ones of all ordinary wayes and means of eternal Salvation? They have as precious Souls as any; and by nature (thro' the guilt and filth of ſin) as miſerable and obnoxious to Divine wrath as others. They have equal neceſſity of the grace of God, and the blood of Chriſt with their firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents they deſcended from: And I know no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary appointed way for their help, relief and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, but by and thro' the Covenant of grace. How ſlenderly do many conſider of this cruel ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, that they cannot free their opinion from? How helpleſs doth this reader all children of pious
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44339:57"/>Parents to be? I might illuſtrate and amplifie this by many particulars, ſome of which I ſhall juſt propound.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) This doth deprive them of being Members of the viſible Church of Chriſt; for this Church is incloſed within the Covenant; to ſhut them out of this incloſure, is directly oppoſite to Chriſts own and open aſſertion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.14. <hi>Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> So that to exclude Believers Infants, being part of th viſible Church in general, is to exclude them from any ordinary State and way of Salvation; this hath been a long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſaying, that <hi>extra Eccleſiam non eſt ſalus,</hi> no Salvation in an ordinary way. To exclude all Infants of Believers from a notion of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Spiritual Seed, from a Covenant and Church State, is to put them into the ſame State of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Pagan Gentiles,</hi> who are ſtrangers from the Promiſe and Covenants, and in a godleſs, Chriſtleſs and hopeleſs State, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.11, 12. This the Apoſtle ſets out to be the deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of all ſuch, making no diſtinction of <hi>potentia remota, aut propinqua,</hi> let this be well conſidered.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) They cannot be judged to be the Elect of God to Eternal life; all that ſhall ſaved, are the choſen to Salvation before all time, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him, before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in love: Having predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated us to the adoption of children by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf.</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2.13. <hi>But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord; becauſe God hath from the beginning, choſen you to ſalvation, through ſanctification of the Spirit, and the belief of the truth.</hi> The line of Election doth uſually, and for the moſt part runs thro' the Lines of the inchurched incovenanted Parents; there the greateſt part of the golden Veins are plac'd. So it was amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> in the duration of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44339:57"/>their Church and Covenant-State, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5. <hi>Even ſo then at this preſent time alſo, there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</hi> Now for men to turn them out of the Covenant of Grace, is to render them in a very unpromiſing Station of the Election of God, to appertain unto them. This is as to Gods eternal choice to make them altogether as hopeleſs as the Seed of <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.</hi> Tho' I readly grant that ſecret things belong unto God; yet from what is revealed, we have little ground to judge that any conſiderable quantity of the Elect are to be concluded to be amongſt the Heathen world; where the Covenant is not on foot, where Chriſt is neither preached or known, where Souls be not converted nor called, nor any ſaving ſignes by the fruits and effects of Election diſcovered nor Demonſtrated.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Such cannot be ſuppoſed (by any ordinary proſpect) to be any of them, that God hath eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally given to Chriſt to Save; thoſe that are ſaved in time, are ſuch that are given to Chriſt before all time: When Chriſt came into the World, to ſuffer, to lay down his precious life, he openly declared, that it was for his ſheep, for thoſe the Father had given him, and for none beſide, <hi>John</hi> 10.11, 15, 17. and 17.6, 9. There was an eternal Covenant of Redemption concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and the Son; in the which the Son did ingage to ſatisfie Divine juſtice, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Propitiation in his blood, for the Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe that were given him: And the Father promiſed all grace here, and everlaſting glory hereafter unto them as the fruit of his own grace, and the purchaſe of their Mediatour that offered up himſelf as an offering, and Oblation of a ſweet-ſmelling ſavour, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. And all this is conveyed and tranſmitted to them by, and thro' an Evangelical Covenant of grace made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to believing Parents and their Elect Seed: For
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44339:58"/>this is the great Sluce, thro' which all the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the Covenant of Redemption do run. Now to baniſh Infants out of this Covenant, what foundation can we deſcry to build any hopes upon, that they be any of thoſe, that be eternally given by the Father, to the Son to bring into a State of grace here, and manſions of glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.28. <hi>My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant ſhall ſtand faſt with him, Viz.</hi> with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) We cannot look upon any of the Seed of Believers to be loved by God from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, (if they be excluded that gracious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact they be in with their Parents,) Gods love to his Elect before all time is manifeſted to them in time; the eſtabliſhing of a Covenant of Grace, is the great effort and emanation of the love of God to the eternally, deſigned and determinated Subjects of the ſame God did ſingle out <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed, from the reſt of the World, to make an open patefaction, and diſcovery of the hidden, and ſecret purpoſes, and intentions of his grace, and love to them; therefore he entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Covenant of Grace with them, not only with <hi>Abraham,</hi> but alſo with his Seed, that being the great conveyance of all unto them. Eternal grace, and love ſtreams thro' it from the fountain of grace and love: So that if they be thruſt out of this, they be diverted from the uſual current of all gracious deſigns and purpoſes; and this muſt of neceſſity render their condition to be very dangerous and deſperate.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) Neither can they be hopefully lookt upon to be redeemed, and purchaſed by Chriſt and his meritorious blood: That which gives believing Parents any good aſſurance of hopes, that Chriſt extended his mediatory undertakings and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for their Children, is the Covenant-intereſt their Children have obtained with them. Take
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44339:58"/>away this Anchor-hold, and the Anchor that is caſt out, will come home, and Hope will languiſh, and quickly grow very faint. But here in my <hi>Doctrine</hi> is a good bottom for Faith and Hope, in our wreſtling with God by Faith in Prayer, for the glorious Fruits and gracious Effects of the Effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Blood of the Lamb of God, that gave up himſelf unto death for us. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf came through the Covenant, and was the great Seed of the Promiſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath this Attribute given to him, That he is <hi>the Mediatour of the Covenant, Heb.</hi> 8.6. All his Mediation is promoted and tranſacted through this gracious Covenant, therefore alſo he is called <hi>Jeſus, the Mediatour of the new Covenant, Heb.</hi> 12.24. And alſo his Blood is called <hi>the blood of the Everlaſting Covenant;</hi> it cometh ſwimming unto us through the <hi>Everlaſting Covenant:</hi> So that to ſhut the Seed of the Faithful forth of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, you do (as much as you can) carry them beſides the uſual paſſage of this Covenant-Blood.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) Neither can they be capable of Remiſſion and pardon of Sin. Infants as well all others be Sinners, guilty Sinners, and have an indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable neceſſity of the pardon of Sin, as well as the Adult; they be born with the guilt of <hi>Adam,</hi> Sin lying at their door, which is a ſtrong Bar to keep them out of Heaven, unleſs it be by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Grace removed: They come into the World, and can never go to Heaven, though they be never ſo few Moments in it, without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Mercy. But where is Forgiveneſs ſeal'd? Is it not in the Covenant of Grace? Are not the Free and Gracious Promiſes great Branches of, yea Eſſential Parts of the Covenant? And are not the Promiſes of Remiſſion, ſome of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of it? Therefore we may ſee that all thoſe that are or ſhall be pardoned, it muſt be by and through this Covenant; and if ſo, where are the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44339:59"/>Hopes placed for the pardon of the Sins of our dying Infants, that are ſhut out of it? I need not (I hope) ſtand to prove by ſeveral Scriptures; that pardoning Mercy is Covenant Mercy, and is aſſured by the Promiſes of it; indeed there is not one Promiſe of this, but what is a Covenant one. Oh! then let us have a care what we do, that we do not dare to diſinherit the Children of Believers, in that which gives the greateſt hopes of their pardon of ſin.</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) They cannot be the Lords Adopted Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, without this Covenant of Grace: Adoption is a Covenant Bleſſing, take it in a general and in an eſpecial acceptation; there cannot be ſo much as a general Adoption without this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as I have ſhewn you, becauſe of this all <hi>Iſrael</hi> was called Gods Son and his Children; this I have proved by many Scriptures which do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with it: much leſs can there be any ſpecial and peculiar Adoption without a Covenant of Grace, this being one of the prime bleſſings of it. Gracious Parents are greatly concern'd that their Children ſhould be the Lords, that they ſhould be the Adopted Children of the Heavenly Father, and Heirs according to promiſe: but this is the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar favour and priviledge of ſuch, that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded within the compaſs and bounds of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Ye are the children of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and of the covenant which God made with our Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. It is by Covenant that ye become Children, and do partake of the Adoption; for unto Covenant-ones doth the Adoption appertain, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Who are Iſraelites, to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the Covenants.</hi> Here we ſee that the Adoption, and the Covenant go together; he that is ſhut out of one, cannot be a Partaker of the other.</p>
            <p n="8">(8.) They cannot be ſanctified nor waſht from their Sins; turn them out of the Covenant, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44339:59"/>you drive them from the Laver of Regeneration and Sanctification; nay, you ſend them away from the very Fountain of Grace, that is open'd for Sin and for Uncleanneſs, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, yea thoſe of the moſt pious and ſanctified Parents, were <hi>ſhapen in iniquity,</hi> and <hi>conceived in ſin, Pſal.</hi> 51.5. Thoſe that ſpring from corrupt Parents cannot be clean, <hi>Job</hi> 14.4. <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</hi> and 15.14. <hi>What is man, that he ſhould be clean? and he that is born of a woman, that he ſhould be righteous?</hi> It is impoſſible that he ſhould; Parents by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation can only convey Sin to their Poſterity, not Grace; but all the hope that they can have of their Sanctification is lodg'd in a Covenant of Grace, where there are Proviſions of cleanſing and Sanctification treaſur'd up; and unleſs Infants be ſanctified, they cannot be ſaved, nor inherit the Kingdom of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5. But the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace is eminently adorned with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Promiſes of cleanſing and Purification. And for this our Lord Jeſus poured out his Immaculate Blood, which is the Blood of the Everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; this he did for his Church, which Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are a numerous part of, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25, 26, 27. And all the waſhing and cleanſing of Souls is promiſed in, and tranſmitted through the Covenant; ſo that for Children to be excluded from it, they muſt be bereav'd and depriv'd of all this great Covenant bleſſing, without which they muſt be loſt eternally, and be concluded with the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and filthy, to be the Fuel of inextinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Flames of Revenging Wrath. But Parents may encourage themſelves, from the good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements that are adminiſtred to them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their little Children, from this Heart-ſupporting, and Soul-reviving Covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Viz.</hi> This is one great Branch and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of my Covenant: <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. <hi>Then will I
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44339:60"/>ſprinkle clean water upon you, and ye ſhall be clean <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> from all your filthineſs, and from all your idols will I cleanſe you.</hi> Infants muſt be included in theſe Promiſes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. <hi>And the Lord thy God will circumciſe thy heart, and the heart of thy ſeed to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy ſoul.</hi> This is a bleſſed Encouragement vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaft by the Covenant of Grace, but deny Infants a Title to this, and then you have no room left to expect (in an ordinary way) their Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Holineſs. So that ſtill it appears to be dangerous to exclude them this Covenant.</p>
            <p n="9">(9.) They cannot enjoy the Lords gracious Preſence without partaking of the Covenant; it is his Covenant-Preſence that is his peculiar and gracious Preſence, that he doth enrich his People withal. The Church, and the Covenant-People of the Lord, did partake of this Preſence, before Chriſt came it was with them, and with their Children, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>I will dwell with them, and walk with them; and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people:</hi> Viz. My peculiar, and my Covenant-People; for unto ſuch doth this Special Preſence appertain; God pitcheth his Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, and fixeth his Preſence, and Reſidence, among his that are in this Happy Compact with him, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.11, 12. <hi>And I will ſet my tabernacle amongſt you: and I will walk among you, and ye ſhall be my people.</hi> To turn Children out of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, is the next way to ſend them from all the Beatifical Shines of this Mercy, and to diſmiſs them from the gracious Preſence of the Lord, and to make them wandring and perpetually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd Vagabonds, like unto <hi>Cain;</hi> yea, this is the way to bring the Children of Believers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that direful Imprecation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.10. <hi>Let his children be continually vagabonds,</hi>— The worſt Vagabonds in the World are thoſe that be ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiz'd with the infamous Brand of being Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44339:60"/>the Covenant, and the gracious Preſence of the Lord. We ſee then, that Men had need be careful how (in reſpect of the Covenant) they deal with poor Infants.</p>
            <p n="10">(10.) They cannot be gathered to Chriſt, nor brought under the Wings of his Mercy. It is an Excellent Promiſe of Chriſt, That the gathering of the People, <hi>viz.</hi> of all the Elect, ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. <hi>The ſcepter ſhall not depart from Judah, nor a law-giver from between his feet, until Shiloh come, viz.</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and unto him ſhall the gathering of the people be.</hi> But ſtill the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of Chriſt is a Covenant-gathering, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.5. <hi>Gather my ſaints together, that have made a covenant with me by ſacrifice.</hi> The Wings of Chriſt, underneath which the gathering muſt be, are lifted up in this Covenant; though his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Wings be never ſo receptive, and large, yet the only way to creep under them, is by getting within the Bond of the Covenant. Thoſe that be not within the Incloſure of it, are not ſaid to be gathered, but to be remote, and diſtant from Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>That at that time ye were without Chriſt, being aliens from the common-wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the covenant of promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the world: But now in Chriſt Jeſus, ye that were afar off, are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt.</hi> You be called and brought into the Covenant, though you were afar off, yet now are brought nigh by the Blood of the Covenant; ſo that all that are not in the Covenant, are ſtill afar off, and remote from Chriſt. This is the condition that Children of pious Parents muſt be unavoidably caſt into, that are baniſhed the Covenant of grace, by which a people are brought nigh and gathered into and unto Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="11">(11.) They be by this way of dealing ſhut out of (in a word) all Covenant-Bleſſings, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44339:61"/>and ſo are repreſented to be in a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable and miſerable condition, this ſtrips them naked of all the covenant-bleſſings, they be cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and inveſted with. It is the promiſe of the Lord, and it is a promiſe full of grace, <hi>that he will ſhew mercy to thouſands of them that love him, and keep his Commandments, Viz.</hi> To many generations of their Seed, and poſterity. I ſhall here inlarge no further. Thus, by what hath been ſaid, you may ſee that by excluding Infants out of the Covenant of grace, they be ſhut out of all the ordinary ways and means of Salvation. For a full confirmation of all theſe particulars, we ſee our friends, the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> deny to the Infant-Seed of Believers, the token of the Covenant, which Seals up all the Covenant-mercys that God hath promiſed and graciouſly provided: For it is to be obſerved, that when the Lord did eſtabliſh his Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. in the 10. <hi>ver.</hi> He inſtituted and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Circumciſion the Seal of the Covenant to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <hi>Abraham</hi> of the performance of all the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes of it is. To deny the Seal then, is to break the Covenant, and (as far as man can) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the Seed of all priviledges, and benefits of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The next abſurdity from the Doctrine of turning Infants out of Covenant is this, It doth not only hinder them, from being Members of Chriſt; but makes them the miſerable off-ſpring and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Satan. Thoſe that deny Childrens Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantſhip, by which they be Foederally holy, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſome kindneſs unto them; in as much as they would not have them to be baſtards, they would not have them to be the product and Children of harlots, and whoremongers; but they indeavuor to make them the Children of the Devil, they cannot be the Members of the Body of Chriſt, if not in Covenant; becauſe all that are his he receives them
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44339:61"/>by, injoys them in, and communicates to them through a Covenant: Doth he pardon them? Doth he Adopt them? Doth he ſanctifie them? Doth he preſerve them? All is through a bleſſed Covenant, without which they muſt be plung'd into a miſerable condition; God is not their God and Father, Chriſt is not their Redeemer and Advocate, they be remote and far diſtant from God, they be in the Tents of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> of the Synagogue of Satan and his Children, if they be not in the Covenant of Grace, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in the Kingdom of God, but muſt be in the Kingdom of Satan, the God of the World, and the Prince of Darkneſs, that rules in the Hearts of the Children of Diſobedience. Until the converted <hi>Epheſians</hi> were called out of Sin, they were without the Covenant, and without a Promiſe, yea, without God and Chriſt, and all hope in the World, both for themſelves and Children alſo.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This takes from, and defeats godly Parents of all ground of hope, concerning the Eternal Happineſs of their dying Babes, Children and Little Ones. A <hi>Pagan,</hi> an <hi>Infidel</hi> may by this <hi>Doctrine</hi> have as good a Foundation to build their Hopes of Happineſs upon, as to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Little Ones, as the moſt holy Saints of God in the World: For what is that, which can give any one great hopes of another, but a viſible Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-State, where all Salvation is lodg'd and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? To turn Infants out of the Covenant, and to make them Strangers thereby to all the ſalvifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Promiſes thereof, is the way to leave them no hope, nor their Parents for them. I wonder what hopes in an ordinary manner (and we muſt not build upon extraordinary things) they can have concerning their Departed Infants, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were diſmiſt out of the World, were by them diſmiſt out of the Covenant. For my
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:44339:62"/>part, I do comfortably profeſs, that the hopes that I have of the Salvation of my dear Young Ones, that are out of the Body, is purely built upon the Grace of God in this Covenant, which I would not be without for Ten Thouſand Worlds. Oh! Chriſtians, Chriſtians let not this Hold of Mercy go, as ever you would incourage your ſelves to hope, that your dear Expired Babes are in the Boſom of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And by conſequence, according to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> we can have no hope of ſeeing our buried Infants again in comfort, when we dye, or at the Bleſſed Coming and the Glorious Appearance of the Lord Jeſus in the laſt and ultimate Day. What hopes can we have that our deceaſed Infants are fallen aſleep in the Arms of Chriſt, and that he will bring them again with him, and you ſhall enjoy them eternally? If they be not incloſed and intrencht in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, vain are the hopes of all in this matter without it. But whereas the Lord in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, hath in a moſt gracious manner proclaim'd himſelf thus, <hi>I am the God of Abraham, of Iſaac, and Jacob, and of their Seed for ever;</hi> this is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground to comfort our ſelves that we ſhall have a bleſſed freſh View, and a glorious Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our little abſent Ones, and that for ever. There can be no ground of a happy Reſurrection to Eternal Life for our ſelves, or Infants, but by and through a Covenant; without this, Parents can have no warrantable, nor comfortable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of ſeeing their Infants at the Right hand of Chriſt, in the Great Day, but on the Left, among them that were never in covenant, but lived and died afar off from Chriſt, and ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all hope. What can we expect to hear of our Little Ones, when Chriſt ſhall judge the World in Righteouſneſs, if they be then found without the Pale of the Covenant, but a formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44339:62"/>though a righteous, Doom pronounced againſt them, to inhabit the Flames of Eternal Burnings?</p>
            <p>Thus I have inſiſted upon ſome of the groſs Abſurdities, that do fall in with their cruel and unwarrantable turning the Children of Believers out of the Bleſſed Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of us all. I wiſh that all that have heard me may ſeriouſly, and impartially without all prejudice, ponder upon theſe things. I perſwade my ſelf, did but Chriſtians throughly conſider theſe Matters, it would not be that many durſt be ſo prompt, and bold, to disfranchiſe Infants of this Covenant <hi>Charter,</hi> as they are. Many make nothing to make Breaches upon the Lords graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Incloſure, that they may turn the Lambs forth into the Herds of the Goats and Wolves. Thus I have done with the <hi>Second General Head,</hi> propounded to be obſerved in the Method of this my Diſcourſe, and ſo I proceed.</p>
            <p n="3">III. To the <hi>Third General Head,</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of this Matter, which is to give ſome <hi>Reaſons</hi> to ſhew, why it is ſo, why the Lord doth take In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants into covenant with their Parents. Many good <hi>Reaſons</hi> might be given for this: But I have been large upon the immediate preceding <hi>Head,</hi> that was in this <hi>Controverſie</hi> chiefly to be inſiſted upon; inſomuch, that I deſign much brevity in this; but however, I judge it very ſuitable to give you a few <hi>Reaſons</hi> of this good and precious <hi>Point</hi> of Goſpel Truth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Reaſon</hi> Shall be taken from the Rich and abundant Grace of God; that is the inward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Cauſe of all this Covenant, is all of pure Grace; and it is a great Birth from the Infinite Womb of Grace. Here is an unconceivable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Riches of the Grace of God to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:44339:63"/>Sinners. Oh! what but unſearchable Grace did the Lord manifeſt in calling <hi>Abraham</hi> out of an idolatrous place and Nation, and to eſtabliſh his Covenant with him, and his Seed for ever, and make him to be the Father of many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Kindreds and Tongues? Away with that pitiful <hi>Notion</hi> of a Covenant of Works, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Bleſſings made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. whereas the very Tenor of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant repreſenteth it to be a Sparkling Conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Shining Refulgency of the Grace of God. The God of Grace takes whom he will, and impales in this Covenant; firſt he was pleas'd to take the <hi>Jews</hi> into it, and leave out all the World beſides, to enter into covenant with them, and to be their God; then Grace took the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> in among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and into the place from which ſome through unbelief were broken off, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. The caſting away of ſome of the <hi>Jews</hi> was the reconciling of the World; God would ſhew his Goodneſs and his Severity to whom he pleaſed, and who can ſay unto him, What doſt thou? — <hi>he gives no account of his matters, Job</hi> 33.13. Grace hath accepted of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and of their Seed to be holy, under the Adminiſtration of the Goſpel. Is Grace leſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding, giving out leſs Priviledges now, under the <hi>New,</hi> than under the <hi>Old Teſtament?</hi> Hath Grace contracted the Covenant more now than before? Hath Grace no Covenant-Bleſſings for the Children of Believers now? And muſt their poor Off-ſpring ſuffer a cutting off of the Entail of the Covenant? Hath <hi>Jacob</hi> carried away all the Bleſſing, and none left for the Children of the inchurched and incovenanted <hi>Gentiles?</hi> Surely Grace is not now ſtraitned. Our dear Lord and Saviour hath the ſame Bowels of Mercy to poor tender Babes that ever he had, and as he had then, when he ſaid, <hi>Suffer them to come unto me,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44339:63"/>and forbid them not,</hi> and declared that <hi>of ſuch are the Kingdom of Heaven, Mat.</hi> 19.13, 14. He took them up into his Arms, and put them into his Boſom, as we may well ſuppoſe, when he laid his Hands upon them and bleſſed them: Hath not Grace the ſame effects as to Children, as when he ſent his Apoſtle to tell the poor awaken'd and bleeding Sinners, that <hi>the Promiſe was to them, and their children?</hi> As when it graffed in the <hi>Gentiles</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> to partake with them of the Juice and Fatneſs of the Olive-tree, it hath not ſpent all its Fatneſs upon them; but if there be any Fatneſs, Nouriſhment, Satisfaction, and Comfort, to have hope in God from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant for poor Little Ones, we have it, and the Apoſtle comforts trembling Creatures in our Text with it, and ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in telling the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that they be inſerted in this Covenant among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and are Partakers of the ſame Fatneſs with them. This therefore doth Anſwer them, that demand and queſtion <hi>How natural ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration can entitle a Man to Covenant-Priviledges?</hi> I demand, How doth natural generation entitle a Man to the Curſe? A corrupt Man under the Curſe of the Firſt Covenant begets a Child in his own likeneſs as corrupt, and as accurſed as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; How comes this to paſs, but through the Juſtice of God, in imputing to Children the Curſe of that Covenant, under which they were born? So <hi>é contra,</hi> a Believer under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, begets a Child, though corrupt as from him, yet by vertue of the Grace of the New Covenant, under which he is born, he hath a Foederal Holineſs, and is a Partaker of the Priviledges of the ſame Covenant. So Grace in the appointed time, ſhall re-aſſume the <hi>Jews</hi> that be caſt out, and graff them again into their Old Stock, and they ſhall be a Glorious People.</p>
            <pb n="102" facs="tcp:44339:64"/>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> Shall be taken from the final Cauſe, there is a double final Cauſe of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Lord may have and reap the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Grace, of this high expreſſion, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of his grace, <hi>Viz.</hi> in taking Infants into Covenant with their Parents; which they do rob him of, that deny this grace to Infants, they do greatly abbreviate, extenuate and vail the grace of God, that will only admit the Adult believing, and repenting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Parent into Covenant; but by no means will their Seed and Little Ones: This is the way to congeal the divine bowels that be full of inward yearnings to incloſed Little Ones. That the Apoſtle in my Text might adminiſter the beſt, and ſo the moſt expedient Cordial to the broken and afflicted <hi>Jews;</hi> who were greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned not only about their own, but the ſafety and Salvation of their Children; tells them, <hi>That the promiſe was to them, and their children:</hi> The belief and exerciſe of faith about this matter, is the ready way to promote, an excellent Revenue of praiſe and honour for the grace of God: What wrong and indignity is offered to the grace of God, by ſhutting of poor Infants that cannot plead for themſelves, for whom the grace of God and blood of the Covenant of the eternal Son will effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally plead, out of this Covenant? Let men talk what they will of the Spiritual Seed, of the grace of God in Chriſt, yet ſo long as they labour to abandon an innumerable multitude of the Subjects of it, they are great Prevaricators from, and perverters of that grace; and ſo become grand obſtructers of that Crop and harveſt of praiſe and honour, that he expects from his Covenant-tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of grace with Parents and their Children.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That ſo by this means he might allure and graciouſly intiee men and women to accept of, and to come under this Covenant: This is indeed a ſweet decoy, that a gracious God is pleaſed to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:44339:64"/>make us of in this affair; this is to inſinuate the minds of men into a well liking of, and acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Covenant, and the Goſpel admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it: This is the ſcope of the Apoſtle in my Text. Here the Apoſtle was alluring his pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and weeping Auditory to accept of this; therefore he milks out of this breaſt of Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that which might taſte ſweet upon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of them, whoſe Sins were now bitter as Wormwood and Gall, and were under Soul-ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fears about their own and their Childrens eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal welfare and condition. Well ſaid the Apoſtle, I diſcern your trembling and aking hearts, your overwhelming doubts and fears; but be ſtill, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, and compoſe your minds and thoughts, accept of the Goſpel diſpenſation, and for your comprehenſive encouragement and compleat ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, I ſay unto you, <hi>The promiſe is to you, and your children.</hi> Oh! methinks, how did this revive their diſconſolate and dejected hearts, and drooping ſinking ſpirits, quickly melting their wills into a ready complyance with the Apoſtles Exhortation, as we find preſently after our Text. If this priviledge were cut off, the <hi>Jews</hi> would have little incouragement to leave <hi>Moſes</hi> to follow Chriſt; to forſake the Old, and to cleave to the New Diſpenſation of the Covenant which was then ſetting on foot, and which they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted unto. They well knew before, that they themſelves, and alſo their Children, were in Covenant with God; and the Apoſtle ſpeaks unto them as ſo inſtructed and eſtabliſhed; therefore ſaid he, <hi>The promiſe is to you, and your children.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I know that this is an Article of your Faith, that which all the <hi>Jews</hi> do very tenaciouſly adhere unto, and this ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued unto you. This the Apoſtle doth firmly aſſure them of, to win them over; telling them that they ſhould be no loſers by coming under
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:44339:65"/>this Diſpenſation; ſeeing the priviledge of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Promiſe to them, and their Children, ſhould not be taken from, but confirmed unto them. This removed all impediments out of their way, and ſo they did readily and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly fall in with the Apoſtles Exhortation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Becauſe the Lord would diſcover his peculiar love to, and care of the Children of his own People. This is a peculiar priviledge, and it is to demonſtrate peculiar love and affection: It is alſo (as I ſhall ſhew you preſently) that the Lord may diſcover his peculiar love to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Parents. Here is the diſtinguiſhing love and kindneſs of God to them both. God hath ſuch a love for pious Parents and their Children, that he hath not for the reſt of the World; therefore he takes them both into Covenant with himſelf. Covenant Love is alwayes expreſt in the Scriptures to be peculiar Love, that God might ſhew even to the face of all the World; that diſtinct and ſpecial Love, which out of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and ſpecial Grace and Favour he had lodg'd in his heart to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed; he was pleaſed to take them both into Covenant with himſelf; and ſo they came under a bleſſed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Bond, which doth not only denote a near Relation, but alſo Conjugal Affection. God hath a peculiar Love for them, will make them his Church and People, therefore brings them under a Covenant Bond, and Compact, and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.37. <hi>And becauſe he loved thy fathers, therefore he choſe their ſeed after them.</hi> This hath been the way of the Lord, to expreſs his peculiar love that he hath to and care over a People to enter into Covenant with them, which is of a diſtinguiſhing and of a diſcriminating nature from the reſt of the World and their Seed; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8. <hi>I entered into covenant with
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44339:65"/>thee, and thou becameſt mine.</hi> Mine and Covenant do alwayes go together.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Becauſe the Lord may lay a good and ſure foundation for the hope, comfort and joy of pious Parents concerning their Children. God knows how much the hearts of good men are concerned about their little ones the Lord is pleaſed to beſtow upon them; how much and how deeply they be taken up in their conſiderate and ſtudious minds about their Eternal State. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Parents know what immortal and never dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls their Children are inſpired withal, that muſt be everlaſtingly happy or miſerable; that muſt live with Saints and Angels, or Devils for ever; they know not how ſoon it may pleaſe the Lord to demand them back again from them, and conſign them to an unalterable ſtation; they know that they have conveyed and communicated to them a ſinful Nature, and as they are deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them, they be plunged in the filthy laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth of Sin, and that they be born under the guilt of Sin, by Nature Children of Wrath: Theſe, and ſuch like matters cannot but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſink and overwhelm the thoughts of good Parents, and occaſion penſive meditations about their little ones: Now for them to ſit down and contemplate what grounds of hope God hath been pleaſed to give them, in relation to the Souls of their Children; oh how comfortable is it? And they find that all their hopes muſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in this bleſſed Covenant, which the Lord hath been graciouſly pleaſed to make with Parents and their Children. A Covenant abundantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with all Temporal, Spiritual and Eternal Bleſſings and Priviledges, which may give full ſolace, and acquieſcing content and ſatisfaction to godly Parents that are thus concerned about their Children. There is enough in that promiſe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:44339:66"/>of the Covenant, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed.</hi> By reaſon of the Covenant of Grace, Believers may look upon their Children to be the gracious gifts of God unto them: So did <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 33.5. ſaid he unto <hi>Eſau, Theſe are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which God hath graciouſly given thy ſervant;</hi> and by reaſon of this Covenant they may hope and believe, that God will graciouſly take care of and provide for them. If Parents did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that their Children were not in Covenant with the Lord, and that the promiſes and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges did no more appertain unto them, than unto the Children of Pagans and Infidels, as ſome do too impiouſly aſſert; I know not what joy and comfort they can conceive in their minds about their Children, nor what can feed their Faith in crying unto and wreſtling with God for them: What comfort can poor grieved Parents take concerning that miſerable ſtate they receive their Children into the World in? unleſs they find ſweet and comfortable ſupport and relief from the everlaſtingly gracious Covenant; which doth wonderfully magnifie the Grace of God to Parents, in that he hath taken their Children with them into it, and makes abundantly for their peace and conſolation. This was that which ſatisfied, and even raviſhed the heart of <hi>David</hi> with joy, concerning his Family and Children; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.23. when his Child was dead, he was greatly comforted and ſatisfied, ſaying, <hi>I ſhall go to him, but he ſhall not come to me;</hi> which words, as I apprehend, denote the good hopes that quieted his mind, through the thoughts he had of the eternal happineſs of his Child, and that he ſhould ſhortly go to him, and injoy the ſame happineſs with him. This good man <hi>David</hi> did meet with great diſappointment in his Houſe and Family; but from the conſideration of the Covenant, he had a never-failing ſpring of joy
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44339:66"/>and comfort, which did exhilarate his Spirits in their depreſſing ſinkings; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though my houſe be not ſo with God; yet he hath made with me an everlaſting covenant, ordered in all things, and ſure; for this is all my ſalvation, and all my deſire, although he make it not to grow.</hi> This is a full breaſt of conſolation, upon which all godly Parents may hang, and ſuck, and draw a fullneſs of peace and comfort for themſelves and Family in their moſt diſcouraging and dying diſpenſations.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Becauſe by this means the Lord may provide for a perpetual and an uninterrupted ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for his Church and Kingdom in the World. That God will have a Church unto the end of the World is founded upon his Eternal Purpoſe, the Mediatory Tranſactions of his ever bleſſed Son, and upon the infallible Promiſes of the never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failing Word: But this is the way and expedient, that he is pleaſed to pitch and fix upon, for the preſervation and perpetual propagation of it; he hath taken his Church into Covenant with himſelf, the Parents and their Children, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of which are to promote and to provide for its continual ſucceſſion; that ſo when Parents have finiſht the work of their generation, and ſhall deſcend the ſtage of the World, their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may take place, and fill up the vacancy in the Church of God. This was one great reaſon why the Lord did take <hi>Adam, Noah, Abraham; Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> into Covenant with their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that out of their Loins might iſſue a Seed to populate, and to ſecure the Church as to a perpetual ſucceſſion in Gods Family, Houſe and Kingdom: So the Covenant in the new Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of it takes in the Parents and their Seed, for the ſame end, and purpoſe. For the great built of the Elect, and body for the future proviſion
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44339:67"/>of the Church, are provided from the Covenan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Seed: Therefore as it hath before been proved that Children are Members of the Kingdom and Church of God, this is one great end why the Lord hath inſtituted Marriage for Covenant Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that he might provide a conſtant Seed for his Church. The Metaphors by which the Church is illuſtrated, deſcribed and lively repreſented do abundantly demonſtrate this; ſometimes the Church is compared to a Vineyard, ſometimes to an Orchard, and ſometimes to a Garden; ſee <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.1, 7. <hi>Matth</hi> 21.33. <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.12, 16. and 5.1. and 6.2, 11. now we know that thoſe that have the care of Orchards, Vineyards and Gardens, one principal thing that they have in their eye and endeavour, is a ſucceſſion, either of Trees, Plants, Herbs or Flowers, therefore they have their Nurſeries and their Seeds. Oh! ſo it is here, the great God that takes care of his Orchard, Vineyard or Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, hath a curious regard of, and reſpect to a conſtant ſucceſſion; and the Infants and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of his incloſed and impal'd Covenant ones, are his Nurſery and his Seed to ſecure a perpetual ſupply for all vacancies, that frequently by Death are incident to his Church and Kingdom: though the Lord doth not ſo confine himſelf, but that he doth ſometimes take a wild Plant, and ſet in his Garden, ſuch a one as he may find in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs or Foreſt of the World; but we ſpeak of his uſual way of proviſion in this matter; and becauſe of this, Parents in Covenant with the Lord, muſt be careful in their educating and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing of their Children, which are the Lords Nurſery, that they may be a viſible and hopeful proviſion for a ſucceſſion in the Church of God. For this very end they ought to have a ſingular reſpect unto, and a careful and diligent comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with that holy command, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.4. <hi>And
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44339:67"/>ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath; bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord:</hi> Thus they muſt endeavour to do that; and when they ſhall have finiſht their work and courſe in the World, that then their Children may ſtand up in their room and place, as the immediate ſucceſſors to them in the Church, in the work and ſervice of the Lord in their Generation. So much for the Third General Head propounded in my Diſcourſe, and for the Doctrinal part of it; now we approach unto the Uſe of this Point, which is the laſt thing I promiſed and propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this matter.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The Fourth General Thing to conclude this Point, is to make ſome uſeful improvement of it by way of Application. I did not, neither do I intend to be large in this particular, only I thought it was pity that ſuch a Truth ſhould be wholly overlook'd without ſome, though but little Application.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> By way of Information. This Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine doth inform us of many precious Truths; it is a Field out of which we may gather moſt rare and excellent Flowers; it is a full Fountain, from whence doth iſſue variety of Streams: Some of thoſe things that may be deduced and inferred from it, I ſhall ſet before you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This doth inform us of the exceeding Riches of the Grace of God, both as to Believers and their Seed. The Grace of God hath alwayes been expreſt in a Covenant way; here is Grace abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and running over to Parents, thoſe that God hath taken into Covenant with himſelf; here it is intended to all ſorts and degrees of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men; here is help to the poor helpleſs Infant, even to him that ſucketh upon the breaſt, and a ground of hope adminiſtered to tender and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44339:68"/>concerned Parents to their dying Little Ones. In this Covenant is lodged a bleſſed plethory of Grace, a full proviſion made for the ſmalleſt as well as for the greateſt, not only for electing, but for calling, juſtifying and ſanctifying Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; here is that which is ſufficient to ſupply the leaſt twig with liquor, to fill all ſorts of veſſels: There was a fullneſs of Oyl poured out in a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant way upon the head of our great High Prieſt, that ran down and extended it ſelf to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt skirts of the garments, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.2. It was of wonderful Grace, that God was pleaſed to ſingle out <hi>Abraham,</hi> to eſtabliſh his Covenant with; and that it might appear in its cleareſt beauty, and be moſt tranſparent, it did compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend his Seed for ever. So in our Text, when the Apoſtle would give his awakened and almoſt ſuccumbing Hearers the moſt ſuitable and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing relief, he opens the boſom of Grace in the Covenant extent of it, telling them, <hi>The promiſe is to them and their children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This doth inſtruct us into the high honour that the Lord is pleaſed to confer upon his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. It was not only an Act of Grace, but alſo of Honour, that God was pleaſed to admit <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> unto, when he took him and his Seed into this Covenant with him: This is that which made the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſo honourable, as it was above all the Nations of the World beſides, they and theirs were the Lords incloſure and Covenant People; and ſo were diſcriminated and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from all the reſt of the World: I may allude to that place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.9. <hi>This honour have all the ſaints; praiſe ye the Lord.</hi> Oh I Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, you that do injoy this high preferment, though you have never ſo ſmall a proportion of the matters of the World, yet God hath gratified you with greater honour than if your Families had appertained to Crowned Heads, and Sceptred
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44339:68"/>Hands; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8. <hi>And I entered into covenant with thee, ſaith the Lord God:</hi> Then did the Lord deck her with all manner of rich and noble Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments; and <hi>ver.</hi> 14. it is ſaid, <hi>Thy renown went forth among the heathens, for thy beauty was perfect, through my comelineſs which I put upon thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. This doth inform us of the great miſtake of thoſe that deny the Children of Believers, as ſuch, to have any intereſt in the Covenant of Grace. This is the Doctrine of our Friends the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts;</hi> but we have (I hope) ſufficiently proved, that God is ſo gracious as to take them into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with their Parents: They be not left out, till they be ſo adult as to make profeſſion of their Faith, Repentance and Obedience, and until then to be looked upon as the miſerable off-ſpring of Heathens, Infidels and Pagans. They that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this Truth, ſhut out the Natural and talk of a Spiritual Seed, and ſo out of a pretence to magnifie the Grace of God, they do greatly eclipſe and reſtrain it. I might have inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the many evils, and the dangers of this, but I muſt not inlarge or diſtinctly ſtand upon parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; I might have told you, and proved;</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That our Adverſaries herein make another Covenant than what the Lord hath made, a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, excluding all the Children of thoſe that are taken into it. It would be eaſie to ſhew that from the Lords making of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant at firſt, and ſo all along, both in the Old and New Teſtament, he never made one leaving out of the Children.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That by this means there is very great and apparent wrong done unto the Infant Children, which are the Seed and Embryo of the Church of God. It's ſad for thoſe that take upon them the power and exerciſe of the Keyes, to exclude and ſhut them all out together. Into what a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtate and condition muſt they be eaſt into?
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:44339:69"/>Our great <hi>Champion</hi> and <hi>Challenger</hi> hath labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed extreamly in this matter; but how poorly and weakly is eaſie to be apprehended by any compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently endowed with Covenant-Knowledge.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) That by this means the ordinary way and diſpenſation of conveying and communicating the Fruits of Chriſts Death to Children, even to all the Infant part of his Church, is cut off. How can they partake of the Blood of Chriſt for their renewing, cleanſing, ſanctification, juſtification and remiſſion of Sins? Theſe be ſome of the great and ſingular Bleſſings of the Covenant of Grace, through which the Blood of Chriſt, which is the Blood of the Everlaſting Covenant, doth in an ordinary way run.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) By this means Men do undermine and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to deſtroy the validity and efficacy of all that God hath been pleaſed graciouſly to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and hath done in a Covenant for Babes: Indeed the foundation of God ſtands ſure, and God knows who are his: Though Men may la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to cut off the Seed of Gods People from the Covenant, yet the Lord is more merciful to them than men are. I make no queſtion but the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Grace of God doth (through a Covenant) ſave many of thoſe poor Children that their cruel Parents do indeavour to ſhut out.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) This cuts off the hopes that Parents from this Covenant may and ought to have concerning their dying Children, this being the ground for their anchor hope to be caſt out into; and this cuts off their hopes as to the Sanctification and Regeneration of thoſe that are living.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) This is the way to render the Prayers of Parents, and of the Church of God for Little Ones, to be altogether inſignificant and vain; this doth paſs a Sentence of condemnation upon them all. There ought always to be poured out a Flood of Prayers for the Seed of the Church. It
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44339:69"/>is a very dangerous thing to condemn the Prayers of pious Parents, and of the whole Church, daily pour'd out upon this account, for thoſe Children of the Covenant that have paſs'd under the Seal of it, and by the ſame have been devoted and dedicated in a ſolemn manner unto God. Let ſome think as contemptuouſly of it as they pleaſe, and reproach it with never ſo much <hi>ſcurrility</hi> and contempt; I would humbly adviſe ſuch, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.6. <hi>And he opened his mouth in blaſphemy againſt God, to blaſpheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven; viz.</hi> them that dwell in the Church. Infants they dwell in the Church, they be a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the bleſſed Inhabitants of it.</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) By this means how do Men undermine all the Churches of Chriſt, that adhere to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Infants, and for their Baptiſm. Many of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> do Found their Churches in renouncing Infant-Baptiſm; accounting it no better than Antichriſtian, and impoſing another Baptiſm, which they make to be an eſſential part of the Foundation that their Church Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is built upon, and the only Door to admit into the ſame; nay, many of them do ſay, that ours are no True Churches of Chriſt, and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we differ with them as to the Subject of Baptiſm, and that we are but as Heaps or Herds of uncircumciſed <hi>Philiſtines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">(8.) By this means there is a great Stumbling-block laid in the way of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in coming over unto the Meſſiah, and accepting of the New and Goſpel-Adminiſtration of the Covenant: They (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi>) are for the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> in the latitude, and full extent of it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are for the Seal of the Covenant to be fixt ſtill unto the Infant; which accordingly in their way, they do ſtrictly obſerve and practice to this very day; but to Aſſert another Covenant,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44339:70"/>which excludes, all their Infant-Seed, this will never go down with them, neither would it with theſe here in the Text, had the Apoſtle mentioned to them a Covenant without their Children. This would have been but faint and cold Encouragement to them, to have accepted of the Apoſtles Exhortation, Thoughts of the Excluſion of their Children would have made them to hang back.</p>
            <p n="9">(9.) This makes the Caſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> worſe, ſince the owning of the Meſſiah, than it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and this in the Days of the Goſpel, greatly contracts and narrows the Grace of God, as to Believers.</p>
            <p n="10">(10.) This bereaves the Church of God of a Multitude of its Members; for Children are the declared Members of the Viſible Church, by Chriſt himſelf, as I have ſhewn. Oh! what a cruelty is here offered to, and an Invaſion made upon the Church of God? If Infants be not in this Covenant, they cannot be in the Church; this is to make ſuch a Church that God never planted, one that is only conſtituted, and made up with Adult Members. I am apt to believe, that the greateſt number of the Church is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the Infant-Seed of it: The Body of Chriſt is but ſmall reſpectively, but this is the way to make it ſmall indeed. Many more things might have been here added; but I have ſaid ſomething before in this Affair, and ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at preſent ſay no more.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This Doctrine doth inform us, how cruel they may be lookt upon to be, that exclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and Children out of this great Priviledge; I mean all wicked and ungodly Parents; for by their ſin and wickedneſs they deprive themſelves and Children of the Bleſſings of the Covenant, the only ordinary way of their Welfare and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Wicked and ungodly Parents do not only
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44339:70"/>labour to ruine themſelves, but alſo their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, by cutting off themſelves and Little Ones (ſo far as they can) by their Sins, from all the Grace and Mercy of the Covenant. It may well be ſaid of ſuch, They are not <hi>Parentes, ſed Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptores,</hi> they have not the Love, the Bowels, and Care of Parents, that they may be Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Childrens Salvation, which they are bound by all Bonds and Obligations unto; but they labour to deſtroy themſelves and theirs for ever. Ungodly Parents are more ſavage and cruel to their Little Ones than the moſt unnatural and cruel Brutes, or Beaſts in the World: All that they do in their wicked ways and practices, hath not only a tendency to their own, but alſo to their Childrens eternal miſery and deſtruction; ſuch declare, that they themſelves are not in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, and they endeavour by this means to exclude their Children for ever.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This informs us of the great Sin of thoſe that were the Seed of the Godly, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Adult, but do not walk in the Steps of their Parents, nor obſerve the Covenant-Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they be under to ſerve, to fear, to honour, and to walk with God, that do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their dedication to the Lord, and to be the Lords by their baptiſmal Vow. What Parents did ingage to endeavour that they ſhould do, they have no regard of, or reſpect unto; but violate the Sacred Bonds of the Covenant by a wilful perpetrating of, and a voluntary giving up of themſelves unto all Sin and Impieties; all that they do is effectually to accompliſh their Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the juſt Procedure of God againſt them, even their utter Excluſion out of the Covenant. How ſad will it be with ſuch, when God ſhall reckon with them, and avenge the Quarrel of his Covenant! This is a Sin that a Jealous God doth reſent with great complaint, and with high diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44339:71"/>
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.37. <hi>For their heart was not right with him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his covenant:</hi> Ezek. 44.7. Iſa. 24.5. <hi>The earth alſo is defiled under the inhabitants thereof: becauſe they have tranſgreſſed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlaſting covenant.</hi> Jer. 31.32. <hi>Not according to the covenant I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt, which covenant they brake, though I was a husband unto them.</hi> How unkindly did God take this of them, in breaking ſuch a Covenant, in which the Lord ſtood in the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous relation unto them of a <hi>husband,</hi> which ſhould have obliged them to Honour, Chaſtity, and Obedience for ever.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This doth inform us of one great ground that we have, and proceed upon for the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of the Infants of believing Parents, that be in covenant with God; becauſe their Children are in covenant with them. This is very evident in our Text, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. Thoſe the Apoſtle had here to deal withal, he doth exhort them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and be baptized, and ſo to enter into the then Eſtabliſhing Adminiſtration of the Covenant, they and their Children alſo, for the Promiſe was to both. Children that are taken into covenant with their believing Parents, ought to partake of this Seal of the Covenant with them, for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is to the Children, as well as unto them. If Children be <hi>Foederati,</hi> then they ought to be <hi>Signati,</hi> there is a neceſſary connection between the Covenant and the Seal; when the Lord was pleaſed to take <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed into cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with himſelf, the Seal of the Covenant was (upon ſtrict command) to be Adminiſtred unto the Infant-Seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. The neglect of which was very diſpleaſing to God. To talk of being in covenant, and to deny the Seal to ſuch that are, is very abſurd; for this is to croſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:44339:71"/>the Expreſs Command and Inſtitution of God. Therefore our Friends the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very apprehenſive of this, endeavour to evade the Stroke of this Blow by their miſerable <hi>Shifts,</hi> and fruitleſs <hi>Attempts,</hi> to prove that that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> was a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works; herein they have laboured in the Fire, altogether in vain, for the Tenor and Circumſtances of that Covenant do loudly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim it to be a Covenant of Grace, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Language of it, if it be ſincerely hearken'd unto, will be Grace, Grace. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Natural Seed were in covenant with God, therefore had the Seal of the Covenant, which was Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion injoin'd them, as a Singular Priviledge: So in proportion thereunto in Goſpel-days, the Seed of Believers in covenant with God, ought to have, and to injoy the Seal of it, which is Baptiſm. 'Tis brought in as a great Objection againſt Infant-Baptiſm, That there is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for it; but if Men will but lay aſide all prejudice, and make uſe of the Reaſon that God hath furniſh'd them withal, they may here ſee a clear Command for it, (though it be by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,) Was it not the manifeſt Will of God, that they to whom the Covenant belonged ſhould partake of the Seal of the Covenant? Therefore the Seal is called the Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. as if to have the Seal was to have the Covenant, or to be in it, there is ſuch an inſeparable commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and connexion between them; nay, we may carry it home here, we may eaſily ſee a clear Command for it; for it was the obvious and the undoubted Command of God that thoſe in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſhould have the Seal of the Covenant, tho' the Seal be altered, as to the Inſtrument, yet not as to the Subſtance, and the Command for the affixing of it remains inviolable: As in the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, though the Day of it be changed, yet the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:44339:72"/>Command for it remains untouched, not in the leaſt abrogated. If we renounce the baptizing of Infants upon a preſumption, that it can only be prov'd by conſequential Commands, then we ſhall involve our ſelves into an inextricable plunge, and intanglement of other great Truths of the Goſpel, which can chiefly be proved this way; that the Adminiſtration of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per muſt continue to the End of the World, muſt be drawn conſequentially from ſuch places as <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. So when it is ſaid, <hi>As often as ye do this,</hi> our Divines do infer a Command that it ought often to be done, and not once, or twice, or thrice a Year, as the manner of ſome is. What Rule can we have of dealing with Women, and cenſuring them, in caſe they offend, but by the way of conſequence, for the Rule is expreſſy, <hi>If a Brother doth offend thee,</hi> &amp;c. Nor is a Brother of the common Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.6. Here I might make mention of ſome great Things in matters of Faith, That Great Doctrine of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Dead, that was ſomething ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and darkly expreſſed in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> our Lord and Saviour proves by undeniable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the Learned Sadducees, that were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement Deniers of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.31, 32. <hi>But as touching the reſurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was ſpoken to you by God, ſaying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</hi> Mark, this is founded by way of conſequence upon that place, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.6. Thus the <hi>Fathers</hi> proved againſt the <hi>Arrians</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied Chriſt to be Eſſentially one with the Father, they held him out to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>conſubſtantial,</hi> or <hi>co-eſſential</hi> with the Father: This is a great Point of Divinity, and a great Article of our Faith; yet there is no direct Scripture to prove it. This
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44339:72"/>is the way that is taken in Reaſoning with thoſe that deny and diſpute againſt the Deity of the Holy Ghoſt; How can it be proved, but by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible conſequence of the Scripture, that there are Three diſtinct Perſons in One <hi>Divine Eſſence,</hi> or <hi>Godhead,</hi> or that there is in our Bleſſed Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour but one Perſon, and yet Two diſtinct Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Eſſentially diſtinguiſhed? Thus, alſo we may read in Matters of Fact, where the ſame Rule doth hold, and muſt be ſtrictly obſerved, as for Inſtance, where it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.4. <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, many of them which heard the word, believed; and the number of the men was about five thouſand.</hi> What were there no Women among them, none of their Wives? The <hi>word</hi> here is not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Gender that might comprehend the Woman, for it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. It is ſtrange if here ſhould be no Woman, that did at this time believe, and were baptized. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> will yeild that here might be ſome Women; Ay, but that muſt be drawn by conſequence. Certainly we muſt not doubt, but that in the Churches of <hi>Epheſus; Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi, Coloſs,</hi> and all the Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> had Baptiſm among them, yet this muſt be concluded by conſequences, or no way as I underſtand. According to the Analogy of Faith, Evangelical Duties are not alwayes grounded upon Expreſs Commands, either in <hi>Old</hi> or <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> but from conſequences drawn from either; as the Duties of praying Morning and Evening in the Family, and alſo in the Cloſet alone, daily read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scriptures, and prefix'd time of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, ſetting apart a Time or Day to ſeek God by Prayer, in a more than ordinary manner. Many more things might have been mentioned and improved in this Affair; How can any Man that is ſo prove himſelf to be a Miniſter of Chriſt? Or any ſerious and pious Chriſtian, that he hath
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44339:73"/>an Intereſt in Chriſt, that he hath Saving and Special Grace, and is an Heir of Heaven, but by conſequence? How many Arguments do the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> found upon conſequences to prove their Believers Baptiſm? When they make for them, then they can cleave to them, and make the utmoſt Improvement, but when they make againſt them, then they be of no uſe or validity, but they cry out, <hi>Give us plain and poſitive Proofs, and an abſolute Command for ſuch Infant-ſprinkling,</hi> (as reproachfully they phraſe it,) which my <hi>Antagoniſt</hi> is wonderfully ſubject to. One great Reaſon why many well-minded Chriſtians run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with their Notion of rejecting Infants Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is their not wiſely conſidering, and ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon what I have (though in much weakneſs) ſaid of the Covenant, and of the new Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it in the Times of the Goſpel: An Excellent <hi>Specimen</hi> we have of it in our Text, where the Goſpel that never was before, in its recent Adminiſtration is preached and believed by thoſe that never were before baptized, there the Adult do enter into covenant, with their Children, and both ought to be baptized, and afterwards this is confirmed by whole Families that were ſo. Alas: it followeth not that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we read that thoſe that were never under the Goſpel Adminiſtration were never baptized before, but many were <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and were upon their Faith and Repentance ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into covenant, and received the Seal of it, that therefore their Children that enter into the ſame Covenant muſt be excluded the ſame Token or Seal of the Covenant, but the quite contrary is true, for ſtill the Promiſe runs <hi>to you and your Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. This Doctrine doth inform us that Children are capable of ſundry Bleſſings of Baptiſm, and that becauſe they are with their Parents graciouſly
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44339:73"/>taken into Covenant; moſt certainly the God of Grace would never have conferred this priviledge in vain; this Seal is not for blanks, God hath great Grace and Mercy to beſtow upon them, therefore he is pleaſed to impale them in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure, that he may be gracious unto them. I need not ſtand upon this, for I have largely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to you what ſingular Bleſſings of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant they be capable of, and what exceeding great and precious Promiſes are made unto them; of which if they are not capable then God hath promiſed in vain, and deluded the faith and hopes of good Parents that are built upon them: But who dare be ſo bold as thus to accuſe God? I have ſhewn you, how that to Infants God hath made Promiſes of the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, of Remiſſion of Sin, of Renovation and Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of being taught of God, of having the Law of God wrote in their Hearts; though they be not capable of Mans teaching, yet what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not the Lord do for them? He can as eaſily by his Spirit frame and faſhion the New Creature in them, as he could curiouſly form and faſhion them in their Mothers Womb; and ſo it muſt be, otherwiſe dying Infants can never be ſaved. We have a late confident Writer Mr. <hi>H. C.</hi> who hath tranſmitted ſuch things into the World, that plainly declare that Infants are not capable of the Bleſſings of this Ordinance, and ſo by conſequence not of the Kingdom of Heaven. I will give a few of his bold Sayings, very fatal to poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants: He ſaith, <hi>This Ordinance</hi> (ſpeaking of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm) <hi>cannot concern Infants, but Believers, becauſe it is a teſtiſication of the Remiſſion of Sins, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the worthy Receiver, and Subject of it.</hi> What doth he mean by his <hi>teſtification</hi> but a Sign and Seal of it? then it muſt inevitably follow, that Children are not capable of Habitual Faith, nor of the Pardon of Sin; for here Believers and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:44339:74"/>Remiſſion of Sin are ſet in oppoſition to Infants (if what he ſaith ſhould be true) as not capable of either. Again he ſaith; <hi>That Baptiſm is a lively repreſentation of Regeneration, therefore can only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Believers,</hi> (meaning adult Believers, that he is pleading for, to be the only ſubject of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm): <hi>The Apoſtle</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>alludes to Baptiſm, when he ſpeaks of the waſhing of Regeneration, Tit.</hi> 3.5. his meaning is, that the Ordinance is a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly body, ſymbol and ſign of Regeneration: It is very true, 'tis ſo; but mark how this is brought in, and upon what account it is; <hi>viz.</hi> to prove that Believers (that is adult ones) that profeſs their Faith, Baptiſm can only affect them, it is ſuch a ſign, body and ſymbol of Regeneration, and the New Birth only: So that here Infants are ſhut out of Regeneration and the New Birth; they muſt not be Baptized, becauſe they are not capable of them, which is the unavoidable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this deſperate Doctrine. Again he tells us, that in <hi>Luke</hi> 18. where we read of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants that were brought to Chriſt; which he took up into his Arms and bleſſed; that the <hi>Greek</hi> word ſignifieth, <hi>a Child capable of teaching.</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if he, notwithſtanding his flouriſh of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, had been able to have examined the <hi>Greek</hi> word, he would not have been ſo confident as to have ſpoke thus: It is great pride for Men to pretend to have ſuch Learning they never had any Education, nor Opportunity to attain unto. I have ſhewed before the proper and true meaning of the <hi>Greek</hi> word in that place, and that from good Authority, unto which I refer you, and the ſame that we have in <hi>Timothy:</hi> Let this Man talk of his Learning among thoſe that are not acquainted with his Education, and from what his immediate acceſs was to the Pulpit. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain he ſaith, <hi>If it be their Duty who believe to be Baptized, then I infer, that thoſe that are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:44339:74"/>of this Grace of Faith are under no Divine Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, nor their Parents neither, to Baptize them, it is only a piece of Will-Worſhip which God never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</hi> He ſpeaks of the Grace of Faith in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and denies that any Infants are capable of it, no not ſo much as Habitual Faith; if ſo, then I underſtand no hopes given to their Parents of their Union with Chriſt, Juſtification, Remiſſion and Salvation. Again he ſaith, <hi>That Infants Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized are not tanght of God, nor made Diſciples of Chriſt.</hi> This is directly againſt the expreſs Word of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.13. <hi>And all thy children ſhall be taught of the Lord:</hi> Is not this giving God the lye? ſo in ſaying, <hi>They be not the Diſciples of Chriſt,</hi> is alſo directly oppoſite to the Word of God; <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. <hi>Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the diſciples;</hi> which Diſciples are evidently Children: Here ſtill you may ſee what fatal Doctrine this bold <hi>Aſſerter</hi> delivereth about poor Infants; can they be ſaved without their being taught of God? Though they be not capable of the teaching of Men, yet they are of Gods, and muſt be taught of him, otherwiſe I underſtand not how there can be any poſſibility of their Salvation. Thus I have given you a few hints of many, that might be brought out of this Authors Works. I think ſuch ſanguine ſayings as theſe are, about Infants in Covenant with God, do loudly call for trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling from me, and Repentance from him.</p>
            <p n="8">8. This Doctrine doth inform us, that a great part of the Scripture was written for the good and ſake of Children; God did greatly deſign and intend them in the choiceſt part of his Word. The Covenant of Grace doth compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the moſt precious and gracious part of the Word of God; though our late <hi>Author,</hi> and my <hi>Confuter</hi> tells us, <hi>That they were writ for the Adult, and not for the Infants:</hi> His Reaſon (I ſuppoſe) is,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44339:75"/>becauſe of their preſent ignorance. This is ſome of this excellent Divines New Doctrine. We may as well ſay, that their Mothers Womb and Breaſts, that the Heavens and the Earth, and all the Elements; that Meat, Drink and Rayment, do not belong unto them; that Eating, Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Sleeping, do not belong unto them: But we may aſcend a great deal higher; if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was not wrote for their ſakes, what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of theſe poor Creatures for ever? Can God, can Chriſt, can any ſpecial Grace be theirs? What are the Scriptures relating to the Covenant, the Blood of it, and the gracious Promiſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, Union with Chriſt, Adoption and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, not appertaining to them? Were not the Scriptures wrote for their ſake? when there are ſo many Directions and Commands abounding concerning their Parents Duty to them in all things, and all for the good of them, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the great concernedneſs of a gracious God for them, and the value he hath of them. Surely if we do but confider, what is wrote of Children in the Word, we may eaſily ſee that God did greatly intend them, in writing of it. I will name a few places; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.6. <hi>That the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to come might know him, even the children which ſhall be born.</hi> Pſal. 127.3. <hi>Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord, and the fruit of the womb is his reward.</hi> Prov. 20.7. <hi>The juſt man walketh in his integrity, his children are bleſſed after him.</hi> Deut. 4.37. <hi>And becauſe he loved their fathers, he choſe their ſeed after them. Iſa.</hi> 61.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.50. A multitude of Scriptures might be brought to ſhow, how that in many Predictions and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and other wayes, the Scripture was eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrote for the ſake of Infants and Children, and the Seed of Gods People. What doth not thoſe precious Scriptures of Chriſt, <hi>taking little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren up into his arms, and bleſſing of them,</hi> apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:44339:75"/>unto Children? Is it not left upon Divine Record for their ſake? But that which is beyond all may make us all to be amazed, which is this; If the Scriptures were not wrote for the ſake of Infants, what ſhall we ſay of all thoſe Bleſſed Scriptures that were wrote about the Holy Child Jeſus, of his Conception, Birth and Infancy? If it be as this bold <hi>Aſſerter</hi> would have it, then all Scriptures relating to the ſame, muſt not be the ſubject matter of our Faith and Hope, but all of them ſhould be expunged out of the Word of God, or ſtand upon its record as idle inſignificant Stories. It is clear, that if the Scriptures were not wrote for the ſake of Infants, then our Lord Jeſus Chriſt muſt come in for a ſhare in this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which well may be called the Doctrine of Devils. This Man is greatly skilled in propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Doctrine, that hath a direct tendency to exclude poor Children and Infants out of the Kingdom of God; not only out of the Kingdom of Grace here, but alſo the Kingdom of Glory hereafter. If the Scripture be not wrote for their ſake, I know not the Duties that are incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon Parents concerning them, neither any hopes of any good here and hereafter can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived about them: But one would think the very naming of this, ſhould be more than ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to baffle it, and its Author, from the ſtage of his Preſumption and Confidence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> of the Doctrine; and all that further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more I ſhall make of it, ſhall be of ſolemn and ſerious Exhortation, and that to thoſe Pious and Godly Parents, who are inriched and honoured with this tranſcendent priviledge of being in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, they and their Children alſo: As your Mercy is great, ſo thoſe Duties that do refult from hence are very great. God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed much upon you, and he doth expect much
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44339:76"/>from you: Where much is given, from thence much is expected: The Lord hath done more for you than he hath for others, therefore he doth expect more from you than he doth from others. A few of theſe many Duties that this Covenant, and your Intereſt in it, do call for from you, I would ſet before you, and exhort you to a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent obſervation and practiſe of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Make a great account of the priviledge of this Covenant State; eſteem it very high, tho' ſome, and that too many reproach and trample upon it; yet let it be a matter of wonderful va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation with you. God hath revealed much unto you, if he hath but revealed unto you a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of his Covenant; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.14. <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will ſhew them his covenant;</hi> or he will make them to know, to underſtand the Covenant in its Nature and Latitude, this is a ſecret that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals. All thoſe that enjoy this Bleſſing, had need to eſteem it very highly. What a bleſſed entail is here upon your Children? Thoſe look upon themſelves to be very happy, that be the Heirs of great Eſtates in the World, though they have not a preſent poſſeſſion; yet there is a ſure and certain entail upon them and theirs: But what is this to the entail of the Covenant? and unto the being Heirs to the Promiſe? How glad would ſome be, ſhould they be aſſured, that ſuch a great Lordſhip was continued to them and their Children? Ay, but here is the incomparable and for ever to be eſteemed dignity, <hi>viz. The promiſe is to you and your children.</hi> Some good Parents when they ſhall come to dye, are like to have but little of the World to leave their Children; but this is their great Comfort, they being in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that they can caſt them upon the Promiſe. How much better is it to leave them poſſeſt with the Covenant, than with the greateſt Kingdoms
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44339:76"/>in the World? I marvel with what Peace and Comfort they can leave their Children, when they come to dye, that ſhut them out of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: Next to a Mans own intereſt in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, muſt be the intereſt of his Children in it. I know not what a good Man ſhould prize more than the Covenant for himſelf and Family. How ſhould this be valuable to a pious Parent? When he cannot ſay, I can leave my Children in the enjoyment, or an aſſurance of any great matters of the World; yet I can comfortably part with them, leaving them in the Arms, and in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Embracement of this Covenant. I would have your eſtimation of this comfortably to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main and continue with you, notwithſtanding the contempt, reproach and dirt that is caſt upon it. Our <hi>Adverſury</hi> is behind but very few in pouring Odiums upon it. I ſhall at preſent mention a very few of his opprobrious ſayings, not being willing as yet, to expoſe him very much, until he doth neceſſarily oblige me unto it: Take a few of his invidious and foul Speeches. He ſaith, <hi>That thoſe that Baptize Infants, Baptize Heathens.</hi> Here he calls all the Infants of Believers; Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens; he cannot keep off from his Infant-damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Doctrine. I wonder in a common ordinary way of Salvation, what aſſurance he can give us of the Salvation of Heathens? I know not that there is Salvation in any but in Chriſt, nor that there is any Name given us under Heaven, by which Men, Women or Children can be ſaved, but the Name of Jeſus. The Covenant was, and ſtill is a diſtinction between the Children of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and Heathens: Let ſuch a one turn his own Children out of Covenant, and Heathenize and Paganize them if he pleaſe: through Mercy we know better things. It is worth while to conſider his great Reaſon that he gives to prove, <hi>that the Children that are Baptized be Heathens;</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:44339:77"/>becauſe <hi>all are the Children of Wrath before born again.</hi> If this be a Reaſon, then it ſtands in as full ſtrength againſt <hi>Baptizing Believers,</hi> as he calls it, becauſe the very beſt of them were Children of Wrath by Nature; ſo the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to whom he wrote. Thus I might ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue with the ſame parity of Reaſon, They that baptize: adult Believers, Baptize Heathens, for they were Children of Wrath by Nature; and how can he know that all of them be born again? I am ſure many of thoſe that he Baptizeth, both in their Knowledge and Converſation, give but ſmall proof of their being born again: But yet every one may ſee, here is a vile ſuggeſtion, that Infants cannot be born again. This doth agree with what he ſaith furthermore, <hi>Believers Baptiſm confirms unto them Juſtification, Remiſſion and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; but Infants have none of them confirmed to them in their Baptiſm; and that the Baptiſm of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants cannot be a ſign of Regeneration to them.</hi> Did ever Man ſpeak with more Confidence, and leſſer Senſe in this. World? Is the Seal of the Covenant of no uſe or benefit to the Covenant Seed? It is little matter what raſh Mer. ſay: God hath made it the Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, and ſealeth up all Covenant Bleſſings by it. Ay, but he ſaith, <hi>Infant-Baptiſm never was ſealed by God.</hi> This is a ſad doom upon Infants, and upon all that are for their Baptiſm. By the Sealing of Baptiſm, I ſuppoſe he muſt mean, the partaking of the Covenant Bleſſings that be ſealed up by Baptiſm: Theſe Bleſſings are either conveyed when Baptiſm is adminiſter'd, or after; as <hi>John</hi> did <hi>baptize unto repentance, Matth.</hi> 3.11. But who hath made this Author a Judge, to paſs ſuch a furious Sentence? The beſt of it is, we have but his <hi>ſay ſo,</hi> without the ſmalleſt attempt of Proof. I doubt not but the experience of many thouſands of Infants in Heaven, and others, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44339:77"/>many now upon the Earth, will teſtifie againſt ſuch an abominable Aſſertion. He addeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>That Infants weep when they are Baptized, as if they did diſſent.</hi> What a Childiſh Expreſſion is this? What think you? had they not as much cauſe of weeping when they were Circumciſed? which put them to the greateſt ſenſe and pain, and gave the greateſt occaſion of weeping. Oh that ever ſuch ſtuff ſhould ſhew its face in the World: Pray conſider, is there not as great a ſign of diſſent in many that he doth Baptize, as a little weeping in ſome Infants? Do they not go into the Water trembling and quaking, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd with fears, when they are plung'd over Head and Ears? So that though he ſpeaks of their joy, a great number of them are otherwiſe poſſeſt with diſmal frights, and want the beſt Cordial that he can adminiſter unto them again. Again he ſaith, <hi>That Infants-Baptiſm hath not one Promiſe.</hi> Confidently ſaid ſtill, without any Proof, I doubt not but my Text is a ſufficient confutation of this; where 'tis ſaid, <hi>The promiſe is to you, and your children;</hi> and many more places that have been mentioned. Now we ſhall come to a ſwinging piece of his Divinity. <hi>I think,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, Habitual Faith, and the Infant-Seed of Believers in Covenant, are terms equally allowable, and probably equally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood among their various Profeſſors.</hi> Now this is to ſpeak through, and to diſgorge his Stomach at once. Pray conſider what things or Doctrines he ranks together to be equal with him; by this he gives us to underſtand, that the odious Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is as grateful to his Palate as <hi>Habitual Faith</hi> in Infants, and their being in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with their Parents. Papiſts breaden God, which (by groſs Idolatry) they adore, is of the ſame eſtimation with him as the two others: Oh! let not my Soul enter into his ſecrets; what
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:44339:78"/>Malice and Envy doth this import? and if In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are not capable of Habitual Faith, which is one bleſſed branch of the New Creature; and if they are not in Covenant, I know not how they can be ſaved. If it be ſo, I muſt confeſs, that I can diſcry no ground of hope of the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of my dear deceaſed Children; but bleſſed be God, I am better acquainted with the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and precious Graces of the Spirit, than that ſuch froth and ſpittle ſhould in the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree affect my Hopes. I never read or heard of any Man that profeſſed any Sobriety in Principles and Moderation (to thoſe that in leſſer matters were not of his ſize and meaſure) to ſpeak after this deſperate rate; thus to rank us with Papiſts, and that in one of their moſt deteſtable Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which have cauſed the effuſion of Rivers of the Blood of Martyrs, and to render our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as we cannot but judge, uncapable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſayed, dying in their Infancy. There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing follows cloſe unto this, which is a new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented way of Saving of Infants, though they be not in the Covenant, nor have any Habitual Faith; and that is, <hi>to have their Sins done away by an imputed Righteouſneſs:</hi> This would be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, had he given us any Proof of his New In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, but not a word of this: Indeed I think he muſt have a New Goſpel to prove this. I did ſay, when I Preach'd theſe Sermons in my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, <hi>That to talk of a Righteouſneſs of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation without a Covenant Intereſt and inherent Sanctification, was Mountebank Divinity:</hi> And ſo I ſay ſtill, not doubting, but in a ſhort time, I ſhall not only ſay, as he hath, but prove what I ſay, as he hath not: I am ſure the Scripture is abundantly on my ſide. I paſs it by at preſent, becauſe I intend if the Lord pleaſe, ſuddenly to demonſtrate this matter: I am a weary of this pitiful traſh, therefore ſhall ſay no more, till I
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44339:78"/>ſhall Epitomize his Books, provided I have a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Challenge and Provocation: Only I ſhall give you one branch of his Charity to us, that ſometimes pretendedly he calls Brethren, the Wounds he gives us, and the Darts he would ſtrike into our Hearts, and the Hearts of our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, diſcover him to be more like an inveterate Enemy, than a kind Brother; for his Pen and Pulpit, as to us, are filled with little leſs than Wormwood and Gall; yea, I may add (from what I have here diſcovered) even with Poyſon: But pray take one touch of his Charity to his Brethren, as he calls them: He ſaith, without the leaſt Proof, <hi>That not only the Conformiſts, but alſo the Nonconformiſts, have loſt the Door, and the Subject that ſhould enter the Door:</hi> So that we have loſt the very Eſſence of the Ordinance, <hi>viz.</hi> of Baptiſm; we have neither right Form nor right Subject; and who are they that enter not in by the Door, but climb up, and come in ſome other way? We know the Scripture you refer to, and apply unto us, <hi>John</hi> 10.7, 8, 9. 'Tis eaſie here to ſee your judgment of us, that we are the Thieves and Robbers that come not in at the right Door. I ſhall ſay but little to this now, for 'tis but the proud and empty ſound of a Man that ſeemeth little to conſider what he ſaith; only I do hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, in the Name of the great Shepherd, Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge my bold <hi>Challenger,</hi> to anſwer this Cenſure he hath put upon all his faithful Servants, that are for Baptizing of Infants at the great Day: Here he doth diſcernably enough Unchurch us, Unminiſter us, and Inordinance us; the Lord lay not this Sin to his door. We have little reaſon to wonder, that he ſhould give us ſuch foul play, when he ventures at the ſame time to deal no more kindly with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that is guarded by the ſtrong Walls and Fences of the Laws of the Nation; for he ſaith, <hi>That the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44339:79"/>alſo have loſt the Door, and the Subject that ſhould enter the Door, and the very Eſſence of the Ordinance, and they their Miniſters enter not in at the Door.</hi> Here is a Man that will not only tread over the low Hedge, but will venture upon the ſharps of the Piltes to vent his Unchriſtian and Cenſorious Opinion. Chriſtians, I hope ſuch pitiful, raw, ſpurious and jejune Allegations as theſe I have preſented you withal, will rather turn your Stomachs againſt them, than open your Throats to ſwallow them. Alas, I have given you but a little to what I might have preſented you withal; let not ſuch empty Aſſertions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt ſhadow of probation, leſſen your eſteem of this Bleſſed Doctrine I have been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Truth is never the leſs precious becauſe it is calumniated by opprobrious and dirty Pens. Look upon this choice Truth by the Light of the Word of God, and you cannot but ſee ſuch a lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious beauty in it, as to cauſe an inconceivable eſtimation and value in you for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Word of Exhortation I would preſs upon you is, that you would improve this Doctrine in the beſt ways, and unto the beſt advantages that you can. You and your Children being in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ought to be made the beſt uſe of, that may be. There be ſeveral ways by which you ought to improve this Doctrine; I ſhall propound ſome of them unto you, begging you to put them into practice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By giving up your Children to God, in the uſe of the Seal of the Covenant; (I mean Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.) When God did make this Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed, he did ſo, and ſo it was all along when there was opportunity for it; the Covenant is the ſame ſtill for the Subſtance of it, and the Seal ought to be affixt to the Subjects; Let Men never ſo much vilifie and reproach it, calling it <hi>Baby-baptiſm,</hi> and <hi>Sprinkling of Infants,</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:44339:79"/>without the leaſt ſoundneſs of Mind or Judgment. That is a pretty Saying for Children to laugh at, which our <hi>Neighbour</hi> in one of his <hi>Books</hi> brings in thus, <hi>That it may be very much queſtioned, whether the Jaylor we read of,</hi> Acts 16. <hi>(that was baptized and all his Houſe) had any Children, ſeeing it hath been obſerved, ſome Years agoe, that for very many Years together, not one Child was born to all the Jayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers in all the County of</hi> Eſſex. This is a pretty Obſervation; it ſeems it was ſome Years agoe, I believe he knows not when, however he is not minded to acquaint us of the Authour of this Excellent <hi>Story.</hi> Let Men talk their fill, pray do you mind your Duty God requires, that your Children that be his by covenant, ſhould be given up to him by the Seal of the Covenant. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have many Inducements lying upon them, thus in this Ordinance to devote their Children unto God: (1.) By this they do manifeſtly own, and ſet forth their Belief of the Doctrine of the Covenant. It is Practice that is the beſt Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Belief of Divine Truth; we muſt not only be Knowers and Profeſſors of the Will of God, but muſt be Doers alſo; that Man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers but a ſlender Manifeſtation of his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Covenant, whoſe Actions are not ſomething comporting with the ſame. 'Tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by ſome, that the reaſon why God met with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and threatned to kill him, when he was ſending him for the deliverance of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren into <hi>Egypt,</hi> was becauſe he had not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed his Son, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.24, 25. (2.) By this means we do openly ſhew forth the Grace and Goodneſs of God unto us, in making ſuch a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and the wonderful Love and Kindneſs of Chriſt in dying for us, which Blood is the Blood of the <hi>Everlaſting Covenant;</hi> as in the other Seal of the Covenant, the Lords Supper, Chriſtians do ſhew forth the Death of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44339:80"/>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Ye do openly declare, preach, and publiſh it; ſo by the affixing the Seal to your Children you do ſet out and declare the Infinite Grace, Love, and Goodneſs of God in taking you, and your Seed into the Covenant. (3.) By this you do enter your Children viſibly into the Church of God, or viſibly declare and ſet them out to be ſuch: Chriſt hath declared them to be of the Kingdom of Heaven, that is of his Church, and Parents ought by this Ordinance to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and openly to declare them to be ſuch. This is a viſible incorporating of them into this body, and a liſting them under the Banner of Chriſt, to ſerve and to cleave unto him. They muſt be put into Chriſt's Liſt, and brought under his Banner, though they do him at preſent but little ſervice. Thus we find in the Scripture, when God hath called his People ſolemnly to enter into covenant with him, to love him, to ſerve him, to obey him, they have appeared before the Lord with their Little Ones with them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12, 13. Children that are brought under the Bonds of the Covenant, and Liſted for the Lord, it is their Duty when they attain to underſtanding to be very ſenſible of the ſame, and to do and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage themſelves accordingly; for God will require their dedication and Parental obligation at their Hands. (4.) By this way Parents do ſhew their right underſtanding of, and do give a good teſtimony unto the covenant which the Lord has been pleas'd to gratifie them withal. Thus did <hi>Abraham</hi> by his immediate complying with the Lord in the Seal of it; by this they do openly declare their well lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, and their great pleaſure they take in the covenant, and how joyful and ready they are, that their Children ſhould obtain, and be made the happy partakers of the Bleſſings and Priviledges of it, and be the open and viſible Proprietors with them in it; methinks Parents ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44339:80"/>and ſet out the excellency of this covenant, and what ſweetneſs and comfort they have had in it, by being very willing and deſirous, that their children ſhould be within the compaſs of it, and as they have done, partake of the rich and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Bleſſings of it. Pious Parents do not know how to live in any condition without the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the ſuitable and ſeaſonable Promiſes of it; and how can they chuſe then, but be very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous and deſirous that their children ſhould ſucceed them in ſuch an Enjoyment and Tenour? (5.) By this they do teſtifie their belief of the Truth, and of the Faithfulneſs of God, and the Veracity of all the gracious Promiſes compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and lodg'd in the Covenant: Indeed the Seal and Token is to aſſure and to confirm all; therefore when the Lord was pleaſed to eſtabliſh his Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed, there was Circumciſion as the Seal affixt, to be a great Incouragement unto the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and expect the Accompliſhment of all the Covenant-Promiſes that God had made with him and his Seed for ever. Now when Parents that be in covenant, do ſuddenly by this Seal devote and give up their Children to God, they do ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie and declare their firm and unboubted Faith in all that God hath promiſed to them and their Children; and in this Matter they put up their Requeſts to God, exerciſing Faith in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes for their Children, and ſo alſo after in their frequent Requeſts for Covenant-Mercies for them. (6.) By this means Parents do as they ought to do, lay great Obligations upon themſelves, unto the greateſt care and diligence that may be, that their Children may partake of the Internal Part and ſaving Bleſſings of the Covenant. What a ſtrict Tye and Bond muſt this be to Parents to be greatly concerned for the Souls and Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of them? They have given them up unto
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44339:81"/>God, as his Children, in a Covenant-Obligation, and have ingag'd for them, now they muſt look to their Charge and Truſt, that the Souls of their Little Ones do not periſh through their default, by their careleſneſs and negligence in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their weighty and incumbent Duty, that the Living God in this gracious Covenant hath impoſed upon, and injoined them. <hi>Abraham</hi> had a great reſpect unto this, which cauſed the Lord to give him this commendation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. <hi>For I know him that he will command his children, and his houſhold after him; and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, to do juſtice and judgment.</hi> It was but in the <hi>Chapter</hi> before this, that he did enter into covenant with the Lord for himſelf and his: Oh! ſaid God, I know that he hath a ſence of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-Obligation upon him, that he hath lately received from me, and he will obſerve it, being careful of his Houſhold that they may perform the Duties, and injoy the Bleſſings of the Covenant. What a cloſe and ſtrict Engagement is this to Parents, that they bring up their Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord? How doth this call upon us to prayer, to educate care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and to inſtruct our Children in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and fear of the Lord?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Improve this great Bleſſing of the Covenant for the Encouragement of your Hopes as to the Spiritual Birth of your Children. This is the great Concern of pious Parents about their Children, ſo ſoon as they ſee that they be once born, that they may be born again, that they may not only be born of the Fleſh, but alſo of the Spirit, that they may not only have a Natural but alſo a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Birth: It is for this that godly Parents do groan and travail. You that are thus concerned for your Children, 'tis the Covenant of Grace that muſt be your great Encouragement in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging the Throne of Grace for them, your Fangs
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:44339:81"/>for the New Birth in your Children muſt be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Ones, it is the Covenant, and the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and Blood of it, that muſt animate, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and ſupport your Hopes in this great Affair; you muſt put the Promiſe in ſuit, and plead them with that God of Infinite Grace, Love, and Faithfulneſs, that hath put you and yours into this Feederal Compact. You may humbly go to God, and tell him that he hath promiſed to be your God, and the God of your Seed, to teach you, and your Children, and to circumciſe your Heart, and the Heart of your Children, to love, and to fear him, that he hath promiſed to pour out his Spirit upon your Off-ſpring, and that your Children ſhall be taught of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3. and 59.21. and 54.13. And many ſuch Golden Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of rich Grace comprehended in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as Food for the Faith of Parents that make conſcience daily to purſue and wreſtle with God, for the renewing and ſanctifying of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Wherefore go to God, and plead his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant after this manner, Haſt thou not promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be a God to me and mine? Is not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to me, and my Children? Thou haſt ſhewn abundance of Mercy in giving them all Natural Parts of the Body, and Endowments of Mind; Ay, but, Bleſſed Lord, thou haſt confer'd greater Mercy than this upon them, Thou haſt put them in thy Covenant, and haſt planted them in thy Houſe and Family, they have a Standing in thy Church: Lord be pleaſed to bedew them with all thoſe Heavenly Bleſſings thou haſt promiſed thoſe whom thou haſt placed and planted in ſuch a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity ſo near unto thee: Theſe Natural Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be great Mercies, but haſt thou not promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a New Heart, a New Spirit, alſo to write thy Law, and to put thy fear into their Hearts? Oh! be a God to me and mine in the communication
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:44339:82"/>of all Covenant precious Bleſſings, in the greateſt Latitude of them. When God had ſaid, he will be a God, why may not we hope for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the fulleſt Senſe thereof? Say to God, <hi>Haſt thou not made with me an Everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things and ſure, and this is all my ſalvation, and all my deſire,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. We ought to underſtand, believe, and plead the Covenant in the greateſt Latitude of it for our ſelves and ours.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Improve the Covenant to Duty and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; let the Promiſes of the Covenant ſtrictly, and for ever bind us to Obedience; where there is the greateſt Grace diſpenced, there is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Inducement and Obligation to Duty and Obedience. The Covenant that ſaith, <hi>God will be</hi> our <hi>God,</hi> requires us, and ours, to <hi>be</hi> his <hi>People;</hi> there is a Covenant-engagement upon us, and ours, to be the Lords. But alas! how little is this thought upon? Moſt covet to have their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be baptized, and glory in their Baptiſm, but ſeldom make this to be any part of their care, and endeavour, that their Children be the Lords. How little care have many Parents about the holy Education of their Children? How they bring them up in the Fear, Nurture, and Admonition of the Lord? How few command their Children, and Houſhold to walk in the ways of the Lord? What Falſehood and Breach of Covenant is here? That <hi>Charge</hi> may be drawn up, and Exhibited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch careleſs and treacherous Parents, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.36, 37. <hi>Nevertheleſs, they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lyed unto them with their tongues. For their heart was not right with him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his covenant.</hi> How many Parents do flatter God, and his Miniſters? Promiſing great Things at the baptizing of their Children, but ſoon forget all, never taking any care according to their Covenant, of the Souls of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:44339:82"/>their Children, that they may partake of the Bleſſings of the Covenant; they are very earneſt for the Outward Seal, but little concerned for the Inward Grace. What will Baptiſm avail for you, and your Children, if you are contented only with the outward Badge and Mark of the Diſciples and Followers of Chriſt? <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. <hi>For he is not a Jow, that is one outwardly; neither is that circumciſion, which is outward in the fleſh: But he is a Jew, that is one inwardly; and circumciſion is that of the heart, in the ſpirit, and not in the letter, whoſe praiſe is not of men but of God.</hi> Outward Priviledges and Ordinances will never prove you to be good Chriſtians; you and yours muſt have the Inward Circumciſion of the Heart, Regeneration, the New Birth, and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, ſhort of which nothing will avail to Salvation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>For in Chriſt Jeſus, neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but a new creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature.</hi> We are ſaid to be baptized into Chriſt, and to put on Chriſt; we muſt ſee that we have an Union with Chriſt, and are renewed by the Spirit of Chriſt, if ever we hope or deſire to be inriched with the Saving Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of Baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Exhortation</hi> is to thoſe that are the happy Poſſeſſors of the Incomparable Mercy of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, admire and magnifie the Grace of God herein, that he ſhould not be content to ingage his Grace to, and for you, but to yours with you. You and yours were all Rebels and Traitors to God, and he hath received both into Favour and Grace with himſelf; God might have taken you into covenant, and have left out your Children, and that would have been an high Expreſſion of his Grace and Favour unto you, but this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd upon you and your Seed too, this gives you the fulleſt occaſion and obligation to magnifie
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:44339:83"/>him above the Heavens, and to cauſe his Praiſe to be continually in your Hearts and Mouths. How ſhould this alwayes affect and raviſh your Hearts? To conſider many of you, that the Lord ſhould be pleaſed to paſs by you, when you were polluted in your Blood, and ſhould ſay unto you, <hi>Live;</hi> that when you were in your Blood and Filth, (through your pollution and contamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) fit for nothing, but to be abhorr'd by God, that that ſhould be a Time of Love to you; that he ſhould then ſpread a Skirt of Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour over you, and cover your Nakedneſs, and ſwear unto you, and enter into Covenant with you, and not only you, but alſo yours, ſhould be taken into the Bonds of the ſame, and become his, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.6, 8, 9, 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What Grace is this, that we ſhould be taken (poor <hi>Gentiles</hi>) and cut off the Wild Olive-tree, and graffed into the Good Olive-tree, which is contrary to Nature? That ſome of the natural branches ſhould be broken off, and we ſhould be taken and grafted in in their place, and partake of the root and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Olive-Tree? What matter of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Thankſgiving to God is here adminiſtred to us? <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Remember oftentimes what you were by Nature, into what a miſerable plunge of all infelicity you were caſt? how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and diſtant from God, many of you before Converſion were without the Covenant, having no Promiſe? This might be the condition of ſundry of you, born out of the Covenant, and every way in a deſperate condition as to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of your Souls, and Eternal Life. I cannot preſent you with a fuller and a clearer deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your former ſtate, before the Lord brought you under the means of Grace, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called you, then you have in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13. <hi>Wherefore remember, that being in times
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:44339:83"/>paſt Gentiles in the fleſh, who are called uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, by that which is called the circumciſion in the fleſh made by hands: That at that time ye were without Chriſt, being aliens from the commonwealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the covenants of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, having no hope, and without God in the world: But now in Chriſt Jeſus, ye who ſome times were far off, are made nigh by the blood of Chriſt.</hi> The poor <hi>Gentiles,</hi> of whom we were part, were afar off, becauſe not within the pale of the Covenant. This was the oppoſition that was between the <hi>Jew</hi> and the <hi>Gentile;</hi> the former was nigh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Covenant; but the other afar off, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken into that incloſure, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. Oh! magnifie God that thou that wert afar off, art brought nigh by the Blood of Chriſt: The Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> is come to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and come unto thee, and thy Family, through Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. What cauſe haſt thou to wonder that art yet within the bonds of the Covenant? and thy Little Ones, the Children that the Lord hath graciouſly given thee to be with thee? That thou and thine are become the Children of the Covenant and of the Promiſe, magnifie God for ſo ineſtimable an injoyment, and improve it to the utmoſt advantage of thy ſelf and thine, but be not ignorantly gull'd and trapan'd out of it, as many are in this day.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Exhortation.</hi> Teach and inſtruct your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſo ſoon as they be capable of it, in the right knowledge and underſtanding of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. As the Lord hath honoured you, in taking you and your Children into Covenant, you ought to be much in explaining and unfolding the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and Duties of it to your Children. This is one of (the <hi>Magnalia</hi>) the great things that God hath written in his Word, <hi>viz.</hi> that we our ſelves and off-ſpring ſhould be well verſed in, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:44339:84"/>with. This is one great way to diſcover the high eſteem that you have of the Covenant, for your ſelves and Children, when you take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to ſtudy to arrive unto a good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, and carefully to inſtruct and teach your Children the knowledge of it. <hi>Timothy</hi> had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious Parents, or Parent that did ſo teach and inſtruct him, that when he was very little, he was well acquainted with the Scriptures, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. Many there be that are very deſirous to have their Children to be Baptized, and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Seal of the Covenant; but little make it their work and buſineſs to admoniſh and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their Children, ſuitable to that Relative Duty, which they ſtand under the obligation of to their poor Children. One great reaſon why many (as I find) do renounce and reject the Seal of the Covenant, is, becauſe they were never well inſtructed into the knowledge of it, nor the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they were bound unto the performance of, by the Seal of it. Few Parents (no not ſome that have the root of the matter in them) do take that care, as they are bound to do, to inform their Children into the Goſpel-adminiſtration of the Covenant, ſince the time of the Incarnation and Aſcenſion of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and to ſhew the parallel that there is between the Covenant firſt openly eſtabliſh'd with the <hi>Jews</hi> and their Seed, and now with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and their Seed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Goſpel is ſent (by Divine Conduct) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any place, and Preach'd, that never had the Beams of its Glorious Light ſhining before; there thoſe that believe and repent muſt be Baptized, and their Children with them, and enter into the Covenant together; for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>The promiſe is to you and your children, and to thoſe that are afar off, and even to as many as the Lord ſhall caſt. The promiſe, viz.</hi> the Covenant, <hi>is to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:44339:84"/>you and your children;</hi> ay, and ſo it ſhall be with thoſe that are afar off, even the poor Children of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſo many as the Lord ſhall call, they with their believing Parents ſhall be received into Covenant with the Lord; <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude all with one word of <hi>Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> unto ungodly and unconverted Sinners: It is to exhort them in the name and fear of the Lord, that they would convert, repent and turn unto the Lord. To Repent is one of the great Doctrines that is charged upon us in our Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to Preach to, and urge ſeverely upon Men. <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> did much fill up his Miniſtry, in calling upon thoſe that did at any time attend upon it, to <hi>repent.</hi> Our bleſſed Lord began his Miniſtry in ſounding out the ſame Doctrine. This is a Doctrine, that we that Preach the Goſpel, ought to be ſolemn and inſtant in. How happy would it be, if there were no other contention among Miniſters than this, for every one to ſtrive to bring moſt Souls to Faith and Repentance? It may be matter of lamentation, to ſee how many take upon them the Work of the Miniſtry; ſuch that I fear, though they make nothing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn and diſannul the Miniſtry of others, are ſcarce able to prove their own Call thereunto; how they labour abundantly more to proſelyte their followers to their Opinions, than to obtain Converts to Chriſt. But to cloſe all; I do here intreat and beg all that hear me, that be yet out of Chriſt, impenitent Sinners, to repent and turn to God, and take hold upon the Covenant, and the rare Bleſſings and Promiſes of it; and for your encouragement, <hi>The promiſe ſhall be unto you, and your children.</hi> You and yours will be taken into this Covenant: If you are not in it already, what will you ſtand, and ſtout it out againſt God, under the precious means of Grace, and the rich
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:44339:85"/>tenders of the Goſpel propoſed unto you? and to labour to ruine your ſelves and Children for ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o far as you can? After all the terrible threatnings of the Word that have been defeated by you, oh let not this be rejected, but let it melt your Hearts into Repentance: This (I ſay of my Text) <hi>The promiſe is to you, and your children. Amen.</hi>
